# Computers

Computers control most of the modern tools and conveniences in the Starfinder universe, from simple door locks to
advanced overminds controlling all incoming and outgoing traffic from a spacedock. Almost anything can be found
hiding inside their mainframes, from the plans for wondrous new technological marvels to some of the darkest
corporate secrets imaginable. That said, most computers consist of simple information and control systems.
Gaining access to computers in order to reach their files and control modules is a common occurrence in the
game—and even sometimes required. The following rules are designed to give GMs the tools necessary to design
computer systems that are both interesting and challenging.

## Tiers

Computers come in tiers from Tier-0 (A basic door lock, utility pad or toy) up to Tier-5 (A large mainframe controlling a city or space station). When using SF material that specify a certain tier, divide the tier numbers by 2.

The base DC to hack a computer is 15+3×tier

Typical stats for computers of each tier are:

|Tier|Price    |Bulk (min-max)| Hack DC|
|---:|--------:|:------------:|-------:|
|0   |50cr     |L-1           | 15     |
|1   |250cr    |5-10          | 18     |
|2   |5,000cr  |15-25         | 21     |
|3   |20,000cr |35-50         | 24     |
|4   |80,000cr |60-90         | 27     |
|5   |320,000cr|100+          | 30     |

## Access and Authorization

Computers are designed for users to quickly and easily gain access to their files and functions. A computer may have *unsecured access*, which allows anyone able to interact with its user interface to perform basic functions. In such cases it usually has secured *root access*, so more crucial features remain available to only a select few. A computer can have unsecured root access, but this is normally only the case for a newly-purchased computer, and the first owner is expected to establish secure root access as soon as possible.

### Access

Access means you are able to use all the basic functions of the computer, which generally includes retrieval of any information not stored in a [secure data module](#modules), the ability to send and receive messages from other devices or systems connected to the computer (which may include access to a planetary infosphere), and control of any minor functions (such as door controls, entertainment systems, light switches, and other common household devices) controlled by the computer.

In most cases, it is obvious at a glance whether a computer’s user interface has unsecured access or whether it is necessary to attempt an Inteligence (Computers) check to hack the system.

### Root Access

Root access is a more advanced form of access that allows you to use all of a computer’s functions and modules, bypass or set conditions for its countermeasures, and look at, copy, add to, and delete any of its secured data. With root access, you can also grant a specific individual with access the ability to use a specific module or countermeasure you control that would not normally be available to the base access level.

You can gain root access only when a computer is first purchased, when it is granted by another creature that already has root access, or when you make a successful Intelligence (Computers) check to hack the system and beat the computer’s normal DC by 10 or more. Normally, root access applies to a computer as a whole, but modules behind a firewall can have their own separate root access permissions.

### Secured Computers

Most systems attempt to balance access and security with a two-step verification process to confirm authorized access, entailing both a physical security key (which might be nearly any tangible object, such as a keycard, palm print, or even another computer) and a password (often a fairly long string of characters entered through a keyboard, but also potentially a voiceprint or song, a telepathic command, or a riddle easily understood if you know the context).

Characters who are authorized, have the security object, and know the password can access a computer and use it for its intended purpose without needing to hack into it. Both a security key and a password can limit a character’s access to only some modules or tiers of a computer and don’t allow the user to access other functions. If you attempt to hack a computer, you gain a significant advantage if you acquire its security key or password, each giving you advantage on your skill check to hack. However, the access granted by such security measures can easily be revoked by someone who already has access to the computer if that individual knows you have somehow obtained a security key or learned a password. Similarly, if you use either a security key or password to gain a bonus to a Computers check and then fail that check by 5 or more, the system automatically locks access against further attempts from the specific security credential used, which no longer grants its advantage to future checks.

## Computer functions

Computers are flexible devices that can be customized to have diverse functions. The simpler things that any computer can do are considered *basic functions*, but some other functionality requires purchasing and installing extra *modules* and *upgrades*. It's also possible to defende the computer from undesired access purchasing an isntalling *countermeasures*

### Basic Functions

Computers are good at storing data, accessing networks, making calculations, manipulating and sorting information, and controlling simple devices such as a fire-suppression system, remote door, or a video camera— anything with simple on and off functions. The GM has final say on what an appropriate basic function is for a computer. You usually can add a basic function with an Easy (DC 10) check; anything more compelx requires installing a control module.

### Modules

Modules define what a computer is capable of doing beyond its basic functions. Computers can have any number of modules. These typically fall into one of four categories: control, secure data, spell chips, and upgrades. Control modules can operate a device or object that is in some way linked to the computer, such as a video camera or even a connected robot. A secure data module contains a vast amount of information, from technical blueprints to financial ledgers or perhaps personal correspondence, which is restricted to authorized users. Spell chips are special magic items that allow a computer to generate spell effects. Finally, upgrades are simply improvements to the computer system that increase the difficulty of hacking the computer, expand its reach, or make it faster and easier to use.

Some example modules are:
* **Complex Control**: A control module allows the computer to operate a complex device connected to it. Controlling the computers allow controlling the device. This module costs 10% of the cost of the device being controlled. When controlling equipment that requires a skill check or attack roll, the computer can allow the user creature to make the roll themselves, or make the roll using a bonus of Tier+2.
* **Secure Data**: These allows storing secured data relative to a specific topic; additional topics require additional data modules. The price of the module depends on the topic’s size. A data module suitable for a specific small topic (such as a video log, a financial ledger, or a building schematic) costs 1 credit. A data module for an average topic (such as engineering specifications for a gun, a company’s employee database, or a large array of maps) costs 10 credits. Modules for large topics (such as the plans for a starship, a space station’s operations log, or a company’s master records) cost at least 100 credits and might cost as much as 1,000 credits.
* **Spell Chip**: It is possible to create spell gems in the form of chips that can be slotted into a computer system. A user capable of utilizing an equivalent spell gem with access to the computer in which such spell chips are installed can cast the related spells whenever controlling the computer. When the spell is spent, the chip must be replaced or reloaded into the chip by a process that costs the usual price of the chip.

### Countermeasures

Countermeasures are specific actions that occur if someone tries to hack into a computer system. Some spring into action only if someone attempts and fails an Intelligence (Computers) check to hack the system, while others activate whenever anyone tries to access the machine in any way. The most basic countermeasures simply remove access from a user or specific user interface, whereas more advanced countermeasures might alert robot sentries or even emit a lethal shock. A computer can have a maximum number of countermeasures equal to twice its tier.

The following are some example countermeasures, but variants of these with different settings re usually available

* **Fake Shell**: Creates an entirely fake network and system directory for anyone accessing the system that fails to bypass this countermeasure. The phony network has cloned control modules and data modules to make it appear to be the actual system, but the control modules do not actually work and the data modules contain garbage files. Each minute, a character gets a free Intelligence (Computers) check vs the computer DC to discover the ruse. The fake shell countermeasure costs 50% of the base price of the computer plus 10% of the price of its control and data modules.
* **Feedback**: This countermeasure unleashes insidious virus software into any system that tries to hack it, causing damage to that system and its programming. If you fail a check to hack the computer by 5 or more, any device used in the attempt to break into the system is infected and becomes unreliable. Any check using the infected equipment has disadvantage. You can remove a virus from an infected system if you succeed at an Intelligence (Computers) check with the same DC as hacking the computer that has the feedback countermeasure. At the GM’s discretion, feedback viruses can have other effects instead, such as granting aadvantage to anyone attempting to hack the infected system. A feedback countermeasure costs 500 credits.
* **Firewall**: This countermeasure does nothing to the intruder but instead partitions off modules behind an additional layer of security. Accessing the hidden modules requires another successful Intelligence (Computers) check. A computer can have multiple firewalls to block off multiple modules, but no one module can be protected by more than a single firewall. A firewall costs 20% of the base price of the computer.
* **Lockout**: A lockout countermeasure freezes a system if a user repeatedly fails attempts to access it, causing it to become entirely inaccessible. Generally, this does not mean that the system is powered down, and other modules and countermeasures can still take automated actions. Lockouts last a custom period of time (for example 10 minutes or 1 day). It is possible to bypass a lockout by accessing physical components of the computer, requiring a successful Intelligence (Engineering) check with the same DC as the check to hack the computer.
  A standard lockout activates if there are three failed attempts to access or hack the computer within 24 hours and costs 100 credits. The number of failures can be adjusted. If the computer has an alarm, it can be set to inform a specific terminal or communication device when each failed attempt occurs and when the lockout is activated.
* **Shock Grid**: The computer and its surrounding environment are protected by a grid of conductive material that transmits a shock to anyone who fails to access the system. This has two settings: one meant to stun and one meant to kill. Normally, the stun setting happens first, with a warning about lethal force should the intruder make another attempt. The stun setting forces all creatures within 10 feet of the terminal to succeed at a Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. The lethal setting affects nearby creatures like the stun setting but also deals electricity damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the computer, allowing a Dexterity save for half damage. The save, damage and price are detailed below, based on the tier of the computer. Only computer fixed to terrain can have shock grids.

  | Tier | Save DC | Damage | Price  |
  |:----:|:-------:|-------:|-------:|
  |     0| -       | -      | not available | 
  |     1| 11      | 6d6    |    500 | 
  |     2| 13      | 8d6    |  2,000 | 
  |     3| 15      | 10d6   |  5,000 | 
  |     4| 17      | 12d6   | 20,000 | 
  |     5| 19      | 14d6   | 50,000 | 

* **Wipe**: The system deletes specified data when an unauthorized breach is detected. This usually causes a number of data modules to be deleted from the system. Unless the owner is incredibly paranoid, this countermeasure is usually set to trigger only after two or more failed attempts to enter the system. Wipes don’t definitively remove data, however, unless the physical module containing the data is destroyed. Information deleted through a wipe can be recovered with 8 hours of work and a successful Intelligence (Computers) check (DC = 5 + the DC to hack the computer). A wipe countermeasure costs 10 credits.

### Upgrades

These modules improve the overall effectiveness, security, and utility of a computer system. A computer system can have any number of these modules, but their effects generally do not stack. For a better effect, a more expensive module must be purchased and installed on the computer.

* **Artificial Personality**: An artificial personality is a program designed to allow a computer to hold conversations in plain language with both users and creatures that lack access. These are not a true consciousness but can respond in arelatively natural way. Artificial personalities are even able to performe Charisma ability and skill checks (for example Persuasion checks), using their tier as a bonus. This upgrade costs 10% the cost of the computer.
* **Hardened**: The computer is resistent to damage, and ignores any attack dealing less than 10 damage. This upgrades costs 50% the price of the computer.
* **Miniaturization**: Computers of this size have typically the bulk of a computer of one smaller tier (negligible for miniaturized tier 0 computers). This costs 10% the base price of the computer.
* **Security**: The intelligence (Computers) check for hacking this computer increase their DC by +2. This costs 50% of the base price of the computer.
* **Self charging**: While most computers can operate for up to 24 hours on internal batteries, this upgrade makes it so that the computer can function for up to 1 week on its internal power alone. Multiple purchases of this upgrade each extend the time by 1 additional week. This upgrade costs 10% of the base price of the computer.
* **Telepathic User Interface**: This computer can be operated by telepaths. Costs 10% of the computer price.
* **Range**: This allows computer to remotely control devices up to a range of 100ft (5 credits), 1 mile (50 credits) or any point in the same planet (100 credits).
