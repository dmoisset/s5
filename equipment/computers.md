# Computers

Computers control most of the modern tools and conveniences in the Starfinder universe, from simple door locks to
advanced overminds controlling all incoming and outgoing traffic from a spacedock. Almost anything can be found
hiding inside their mainframes, from the plans for wondrous new technological marvels to some of the darkest
corporate secrets imaginable. That said, most computers consist of simple information and control systems.
Gaining access to computers in order to reach their files and control modules is a common occurrence in the
game—and even sometimes required. The following rules are designed to give GMs the tools necessary to design
computer systems that are both interesting and challenging.

## Tiers

Computers come in tiers from Tier-0 (A basic door lock, utility pad or toy) up to Tier-5 (A large mainframe controlling a city or space station). When using SF material that specify a certain tier, divide the tier numbers by 2.

The base DC to hack a computer is 15+3×tier

Typical stats for computers of each tier are:

|Tier|Price    |Bulk (min-max)| Hack DC|
|---:|--------:|:------------:|-------:|
|0   |50cr     |L-1           | 15     |
|1   |250cr    |5-10          | 18     |
|2   |5000cr   |15-25         | 21     |
|3   |20000cr  |35-50         | 24     |
|4   |80000cr  |60-90         | 27     |
|5   |320000cr |100+          | 30     |

## Access and Authorization

Computers are designed for users to quickly and easily gain access to their files and functions. A computer may have *unsecured access*, which allows anyone able to interact with its user interface to perform basic functions. In such cases it usually has secured *root access*, so more crucial features remain available to only a select few. A computer can have unsecured root access, but this is normally only the case for a newly-purchased computer, and the first owner is expected to establish secure root access as soon as possible.

### Access

Access means you are able to use all the basic functions of the computer, which generally includes retrieval of any information not stored in a [secure data module](#modules), the ability to send and receive messages from other devices or systems connected to the computer (which may include access to a planetary infosphere), and control of any minor functions (such as door controls, entertainment systems, light switches, and other common household devices) controlled by the computer.

In most cases, it is obvious at a glance whether a computer’s user interface has unsecured access or whether it is necessary to attempt an Inteligence (Computers) check to hack the system.

### Root Access

Root access is a more advanced form of access that allows you to use all of a computer’s functions and modules, bypass or set conditions for its countermeasures, and look at, copy, add to, and delete any of its secured data. With root access, you can also grant a specific individual with access the ability to use a specific module or countermeasure you control that would not normally be available to the base access level.

You can gain root access only when a computer is first purchased, when it is granted by another creature that already has root access, or when you make a successful Intelligence (Computers) check to hack the system and beat the computer’s normal DC by 10 or more. Normally, root access applies to a computer as a whole, but modules behind a firewall can have their own separate root access permissions.

### Secured Computers

Most systems attempt to balance access and security with a two-step verification process to confirm authorized access, entailing both a physical security key (which might be nearly any tangible object, such as a keycard, palm print, or even another computer) and a password (often a fairly long string of characters entered through a keyboard, but also potentially a voiceprint or song, a telepathic command, or a riddle easily understood if you know the context).

Characters who are authorized, have the security object, and know the password can access a computer and use it for its intended purpose without needing to hack into it. Both a security key and a password can limit a character’s access to only some modules or tiers of a computer and don’t allow the user to access other functions. If you attempt to hack a computer, you gain a significant advantage if you acquire its security key or password, each giving you advantage on your skill check to hack. However, the access granted by such security measures can easily be revoked by someone who already has access to the computer if that individual knows you have somehow obtained a security key or learned a password. Similarly, if you use either a security key or password to gain a bonus to a Computers check and then fail that check by 5 or more, the system automatically locks access against further attempts from the specific security credential used, which no longer grants its advantage to future checks.

## Computer functions

Computers are flexible devices that can be customized to have diverse functions. The simpler things that any computer can do are considered *basic functions*, but some other functionality requires purchasing and installing extra *modules* and *upgrades*. It's also possible to defende the computer from undesired access purchasing an isntalling *countermeasures*

### Basic Functions

Computers are good at storing data, making calculations, manipulating and sorting information, and controlling simple devices such as a fire-suppression system, remote door, or a video camera— anything with simple on and off functions. The GM has final say on what an appropriate basic function is for a computer. You usually can add a basic function with an Easy (DC 10) check; anything more compelx requires installing a control module.

### Modules

Modules define what a computer is capable of doing beyond its basic functions. Computers can have any number of modules. These typically fall into one of four categories: control, secure data, spell chips, and upgrades. Control modules can operate a device or object that is in some way linked to the computer, such as a video camera or even a connected robot. A secure data module contains a vast amount of information, from technical blueprints to financial ledgers or perhaps personal correspondence, which is restricted to authorized users. Spell chips are special magic items that allow a computer to generate spell effects. Finally, upgrades are simply improvements to the computer system that increase the difficulty of hacking the computer, expand its reach, or make it faster and easier to use.

### Countermeasures

Countermeasures are specific actions that occur if someone tries to hack into a computer system. Some spring into action only if someone attempts and fails an Intelligence (Computers) check to hack the system, while others activate whenever anyone tries to access the machine in any way. The most basic countermeasures simply remove access from a user or specific user interface, whereas more advanced countermeasures might alert robot sentries or even emit a lethal shock. A computer can have a maximum number of countermeasures equal to twice its tier.

### Upgrades

These modules improve the overall effectiveness, security, and utility of a computer system. A computer system can have any number of these modules, but their effects generally do not stack. For a better effect, a more expensive module must be purchased and installed on the computer.
