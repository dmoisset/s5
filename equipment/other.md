## Equipment Packs

The “essential pack” has some  basic items that most characters will need, including: a consumer backpack, everyday clothing, hygiene kit, and a flashlight

## Medical Equipment

People get hurt, and even more if they are adventurers. Luckily, there's plenty of medical gear to be able to deal with almost anything:

|Item|Price|Hands|Bulk|
|----|----:|:---:|---:|
|Medkit (Basic)|100|2|1|
|Medkit (Advanced)|2700|2|1|
|Medical Lab|7000|2|50|
|Medpatch|50|1|L|
|Regeneration Table|45000|2|20|
|Sprayflesh|440|1|L|

#### Medkit (Basic)
This reusable kit allows you to [treat wounds](../rules/health-and-resolve.md#treating-wounds) with a DC 20 Wisdom(Medicine) check

#### Medkit (Advanced)
This reusable kit allows you to [treat wounds](../rules/health-and-resolve.md#treating-wounds) with a DC 15 Wisdom(Medicine) check. It also grants you advantage on checks to treat drugs, diseases or poison. Additionally, you can use an advanced medkit to set up a temporary one-patient medical lab, though this requires 10 minutes. You can then provide [long-term stability care](../rules/health-and-resolve.md#long-term-stability) to a single patient using the temporary medical lab (with the usual DC 10 Wisdom(Medicine) check)

#### Medical Lab
Usually not portable (unless installed on a vehicle or starship), this lab can have 3 patients under treatment. Patients there can receive a [treat wounds](../rules/health-and-resolve.md#treating-wounds) twice per day (instead of the usual limit of one). A medical lab also includes everything that an [Advanced Medkit](#medkit-advanced) has.

#### Medpatch
This single-use device can be slapped into an affected area (wounded, diseased, poisoned), and grants you advantage on Wisdom (Medicine) checks to apply [First Aid](../rules/health-and-resolve.md#stabilizing), [Long-Term Stability care](../rules/health-and-resolve.md#long-term-stability), and treating diseases, drugs or poison.

#### Regeneration Table
A regeneration table is a medical bed that uses the most advanced medical technology known in the Pact Worlds to restore a creature’s body to full function from nearly any mishap or injury, including death. It does this with quantumlocked nanites held in a suspended state from which they can become nearly any form of matter, including stem cells for biological creatures or mechanical components for artificial creatures like androids. The table both reads the creature’s own genetic code (or equivalent data) and uses supercomputing predictive algorithms to determine what damage or affliction is present, then attempts to restore the subject to perfect health based on that information.

A living creature using a regeneration table receives a non-magical benefit equivalent to having received a *Heal* spell and as many *Lesser Restoration* and *Greater Restoration* spells as needed. A dead creature is instead affected as if *Revivify* or *Raise Dead* were cast on it.

As a result of its need to perfectly attune itself to one creature suffering one exact set of ailments and the expenditure of its quantum state particles, a regeneration table functions only once and is then inert and useless.

#### Sprayflesh

If you are not proficient in Medicine, this single-use device acts as a [Medpatch](#medpatch). If you are proficient you can also use this to set a wound so it will heal faster, by making a DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. If you succeed, the patient receives the benefit of a [treat wounds](../rules/health-and-resolve.md#treating-wounds) on her next short or long rest. This can be done even on creatures that have received the maximum number of wound treatments per day.

## Gadgets

The follwing technological devices are available to those willing to pay for them. Some of them need free hands to operate, and all require a charged battery, which is consumed as described:

|Item|Price|Hands|Bulk|Capacity|Usage|
|----|----:|:---:|:--:|-------:|-----|
|Holoskin|500|—|L|20|1/10 min|
|Laser Microphone|2725|2|L|10|1/min|
|Motion Detector|6000|1|L|10|1/hour|
|Signal Jammer|400+|—|L|12|1/10 min|
|Spy Drone|4550|—|L|20|1/min|
|X-Ray Visor|15000|—|L|40|1/rd|

#### Holoskin
This holographic projector is generally mounted to a belt or arm strap. It can be programmed using the Charisma (Deception) skill to project a different appearance.

#### Laser Microphone
This handheld sensor allows you to hear through normally sound-impervious materials at great range. It grants you sense through (hearing), but only through materials that are 1 inch thick or thinner, and each Wisdom (Perception) check attempted using it takes a full round with no actions or movement, during which you gain the same penalties as being paralyzed.

#### Motion Detector
This handheld scanner is capable of detecting the locomotion of creatures and vehicles. Motion detectors have blindsense (vibration) out to 30 feet, but you must take a bonus action each round to use the sensor.

#### Signal Jammer
This handheld device, originally designed by the Stewards for military uses, is used by corporations and criminals alike. When activated, a signal jammer interrupts broadcast signals within 4 miles. If attached to a larger broadcasting station (such as those found aboard a starship), the range increases to 12 miles. A signal jammer blocks all communication devices from sending and receiving broadcasts. You can attempt an Intelligence (Computers) or Intelligence (Engineering) check to bypass a signal jammer’s effects or to determine the location of the jammer. The DC to bypass a signal jammer is 14, and attempting this check takes 1 minute. Stronger signal jammers are available for higher prices (DC 15: 3600cr; DC 16: 10000cr; DC 17: 19600cr; DC 18: 32400).

#### Spy Drone
A spy drone is a Tiny remote drone designed specifically to make observations at a distance. This acts as the flight drone of a 1st-level mechanic (and you control it as if you were a 1st-level mechanic, using its remote control or a computer with an added module to control the spy drone), except it cannot make any attacks and it has no weapon mounts, no feats, and no ability to add drone mods. Its skill unit is always Stealth. It cannot speak, but it does understand one language (chosen by you at the time of purchase) and allows you to attempt Wisdom (Perception) checks using your own bonus when you directly control it (as the master control ability of a mechanic drone).

A drone can be upgraded with any one of the following technological items by paying 125% of the item’s price: flashlight, grappler, lantern, laser microphone, motion detector, scanner, or X-ray visor. The price of buying and installing one upgrade includes the price of replacing an old upgrade on a drone, if applicable.

#### X-ray visor
This device is worn over the eyes. It emits x-rays and receives them back combining that information wth your normal vision. It allows you to see through 2 feet of wood or plastic, 1 foot of stone, 2 inches of common metal or 1 inch of lead or any starmetal. The information you get is shown in black and white, and you can’t use any special sight senses (like darkvision) while wearing these. Turning these on or off is a bonus action.

## Tools

The following tools/toolkits are available. Using these toolkits requires proficiency can be gained through certain classes and backgrounds.

Tools can make it possible an impossible task, or much easier. The GM can require your character to have a specific tool to make a skill check at all, or give you disadvantage if you don’t have the tools.

If you’re proficient with a tool, while attempting a task where there’s no specific skill for it or a skill you’re not generally proficient at, you can make an ability check adding your proficiency modifier. The GM may limit the results of that check. For example, proficiency in the *engineering toolkit* but not in Engineering may allow you to disassemble something, or to help an Engineer modifying some device, but not to design and apply the modifications by yourself.

### Crafting tools

These toolkits cost 445 each and have light bulk. They allow you to create other items.

**Armorcrafter Tools:** Allows you to repair, resize or upgrade armor

**Drug Lab:** Allows you to craft drugs, medicines and poisons with Intelligence (Life Sciences) (or Physical Sciences for some poisons). Can also be used to identify these items.

**Trapsmith’s Tools:** Equipment for crafting mundane (with Engineering) and magical (with Mysticism) traps

**Weaponsmithing Kit:** Allows you to build and repair weapons

Generally, other toolkits to build and repair a specific kind of item also cost 445cr and have light bulk.

### Toolkits

These toolkits cost 20 each and have light bulk.

**:five: Disguise Kit:** This pouch of cosmetics, hair dye, and small props lets you create disguises that change your physical appearance. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your Proficiency Bonus to any Ability Checks you make to create a visual disguise.

**Hacking Kit:** Allows you to interact with a computer that you have physical access to but doesn’t provide a user interface. Needed for Intelligence (Computer) checks under those circumstances.

**General Engineering Toolkit:** An assortment of general tools for pulling stuff apart and putting it back together. Needed for most repair jobs using the Intelligence (Engineering) skill.

**Security Toolkit:** A set of small and delicate tools (including screwdrivers, files, picks, pliers) to work on small and delicate mechanisms like the ones typically used in locks and some traps. Also includes chips and cards to interface with electronic locks. These replace Thieves’ tools.

**Navigation Tools:** This set of instruments is used for navigation at land ansea. Proficiency with navigator's tools lets you chart a course (on foot or on a vehicle) and follow navigation charts. In addition, these tools allow you to add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check you make to avoid getting lost.

**Rider’s Kit:** Equipment for riding a specific kind of animal

### Other tools

Other tools you may know how to use include:

* Musical instruments
* Tools for any hobby (painting, wood carving, basket weaving)
* Gaming set (cards, dice, board games, miniatures)

Price for these varies but generally should be under 100 credits unless the tool is extremely complicated, uncommon, or big (a grand piano is probably above 100 credits, although an electronic keyboard isn’t).

## Medicinals

Though numerous pharmaceuticals and similar substances can be referred to as medicinals, this entry refers specifically to substances primarily used to treat ailments and which lack addictive properties. However, many medicinals can also be used to help incapacitate a target or capture one largely unharmed. Medicinals can be delivered in the same way as drugs, including via a successful attack with a weapon with the injection weapon special property.

|Medicinal|Price|
|---------|----:|
|Antitoxin|200|
|Sal Volatile|150|
|Sedative, Tier I|150|
|Sedative, Tier II|3000|
|Sedative, Tier III|15000|
|Sedative, Tier IV|23500|
|Stimulant|500|

#### :five: Antitoxin
A creature that is administered this gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.

#### Sal Volatile
This salts restore consciousness quickly once administered (and are available as inhalable or injectable). If you are unconscious due to being at 0 HP, you also gain 1 HP. If you are unconscious due to a failed saving throw, you must succeed at a new saving throw vs the effect that caused the unconsciousness.

#### Sedative
Numerous mild sedatives commonly available for purchase have legitimate medical uses, but they are also popular among some bounty hunters to help capture their quarries alive. If you take or are injected with a sedative, you take nonlethal poison damage. A tier 1 sedative deals 1d4 damage, a tier 2 sedative deals 2d4 damage, a tier 3 sedative deals 4d4 damage, and a tier 4 sedative deals 8d4 damage. If the creature taking the sedative is under an effect causing it to be charmed or frightened, it's allowed a new saving throw against it. If the save succeeds, the effect is suppressed for 10 minutes.

#### Stimulant
Stimulants provide a quick burst of energy and are popular among soldiers on watch, though jitteriness is a common side effect. For 1 hour, you are immune to effects of sleep deprivation, and you get advantage on saving throws to prevent other sources of exhaustion. During this time, you get disadvantage on Dexterity based ability and skill checks.
