## Medical Equipment

People get hurt, and even more if they are adventurers. Luckily, there's plenty of medical gear to be able to deal with almost
anything:

|Item|Price|Hands|Bulk|
|----|----:|:---:|---:|
|Medkit (Basic)|100|2|1|
|Medkit (Advanced)|2700|2|1|
|Medical Lab|7000|2|50|
|Medpatch|50|1|L|
|Regeneration Table|45000|2|20|
|Sprayflesh|440|1|L|

#### Medkit (Basic)
This reusable kit allows you to [treat wounds](../rules/health-and-resolve.md#treating-wounds) with a DC 20 Wisdom(Medicine) check

#### Medkit(Advanced)
This reusable kit allows you to treat wounds with a DC 15 Wisdom(Medicine) check. It also grants you advantage on checks to treat with drugs, diseases or poison. Additionally, you can use an advanced medkit to set up a temporary one-patient medical lab, though this requires 10 minutes. You can then provide long-term care to a single patient using the temporary medical lab (with the usual DC 20 Wisdom(Medicine) check)

#### Medical Lab
Usually not portable (unless installed on a vehicle or starship), this lab can have 3 patients under treatment. Patients there can receive the treat wounds twice per day (instead of the usual limit of one). A medical lab also includes everything that an advanced medkit has.

#### Medpatch
This single use device can be slapped into an affected area (wounded, diseased, poisoned), and grants you advantage on Medicine checks to apply First Aid, long term stability, and treating diseases, drugs or poison.

#### Regeneration Table
A regeneration table is a medical bed that uses the most advanced medical technology known in the Pact Worlds to restore a creature’s body to full function from nearly any mishap or injury, including death. It does this with quantumlocked nanites held in a suspended state from which they can become nearly any form of matter, including stem cells for biological creatures or mechanical components for artificial creatures like androids. The table both reads the creature’s own genetic code (or equivalent data) and uses supercomputing predictive algorithms to determine what damage or affliction is present, then attempts to restore the subject to perfect health based on that information.
A living creature using a regeneration table receives a non-magical benefit equivalent to having received a Heal spell and as many Lesser Restoration and Greater Restoration spells as needed. A dead creature is instead affected as if Revivify or Raise Dead were cast on it.

As a result of its need to perfectly attune itself to one creature suffering one exact set of ailments and the expenditure of its quantum state particles, a regeneration table functions only once and is then inert and useless.

#### Sprayflesh
If you are not proficient in medicine, this single use device acts as a medpatch. If you are proficient you can also use this to set a wound so it will heal faster, by making a DC 20 Wisdom(Medicine) check. If you succeed, the patient receives the benefit of a treat wounds on her next short or long rest. This can be done even on creatures that have received the maximum number of wound treatments per day.
