# Magic Items

While plenty of technology in Starfinder incorporates magical elements, some items operate solely through eldritch principles and thus follow different rules. This section covers magic items not addressed under another rules system (such as weapon fusions or augmentations). Magic items are often divided into held, worn, and consumable items. Held items (such as orbs and rods) must be held in a hand or similar appendage and activated manually like a weapon. Some of these may require attunement.

Worn magic items are things like rings, cloaks, amulets, and gloves. All of these items require attunement, and are subject to the normal rules around attunement. You can’t wear more than one of the same type of item (two cloaks, two hats, etc.) except for rings.

Lastly, consumables are magic items like serums or spell ampoules that create an immediate and temporary effect when ingested.

# Hybrid Items

Hybrid equipment makes use of both technology and magic; though not necessarily in equal measure, both forces are crucial to the item’s function. Effects that modify or otherwise apply to magic or technological items also work when applied to hybrid items.

In some cases, hybrid items may require charges. However, such charged hybrid items typically function in a different way from charged technological items, whose batteries must be recharged or replaced. A hybrid item’s charges are inherent to the construction of the item and can’t be replenished with generators or batteries. Charges for a hybrid item either refresh each day or never refresh, depending on the item.

Hybrid items you wear on your body count as magic items when you are determining how many you can use at once, and also require attunement. You cannot wear a magic item and hybrid item of the same type at the same time.

#### Aeon stone

Aeon stones are magic gemstones that orbit your head (or the nearest equivalent of a head, for species that lack heads) and grant you a constant magic effect. They do not count toward your worn magic item limit and do not require attunement. Aeon stones are categorized by their shape and color, with all stones of the same shape and color having the same magic abilities.

Placing or removing an aeon stone in orbit around your head is an action. An aeon stone must be in orbit for you to benefit from its abilities. The stone orbits at a distance of 3 inches to 3 feet, as you prefer, but always outside any armor or helmet you wear. An orbiting aeon stone has an Armor Class equal to 12 + your proficiency bonus, and it can be attacked directly or even grabbed with a Dexterity check. Aeon stones are capable of glowing with a bright light. As an action you can activate or deactivate the illumination of an aeon stone, which increases the light level 5 ft around you.

Each aeon stone also has at least one other power that comes into effect when in orbit around you, detailed in the individual descriptions below:

* **Clear spindle**: This aeon stone sustains you by negating the need for food or water.
* **Iridiscent spindle**: This aeon stone sustains you by negating the need to breathe.

#### Amulet of Camouflage

This modest amulet projects a simple pattern over your outer layers of armor, clothing, and equipment, which helps you blend into the background. When in an environment with a maximum sight distance Wisdom (Perception) checks of others creatures trying to see you are done at disadvantage. The amulet’s magic isn’t powerful enough to make you invisible or grant a bonus to Stealth checks. You can activate or deactivate this camouflage as an action.

#### Charge Cloak

A charge cloak can power devices that depend on electrical charges as if it were a battery. The cloak produces 4 charges each day, but they must be used as a single unit. Thus you could power a single attack from a *yellow star plasma sword*, which has a usage of 4, but you could also make only a single attack with a *sub zero pistol*, which has a usage of 1. The item must be one which uses charges or a battery, rather than petrol, rockets, rounds, or other forms of ammunition or power. You must be wearing or touching the item to be charged. You cannot use this item to recharge a battery or item; it can only be used to directly power an item for a single usage.

#### Efficient Bandolier [hybrid]

This bandolier fits over any Medium creature and contains five compartments, each corresponding to a specific type of weapon: melee weapons, small arms, longarms, heavy weapons, and explosives. Each compartment contains an extradimensional space designed to house up to 1 bulk of ammunition or batteries (for this purpose, 10 batteries or pieces of ammunition with no bulk count as having light bulk). The bandolier does not accumulate bulk even as its compartments are filled.

Each efficient bandolier includes an advanced AI capable of controlling the bandolier’s robotic components to suit your needs. As a bonus action, you can command an efficient bandolier to draw up to 1 bulk worth of batteries or ammunition, placing the items directly into one of your hands.

#### Mindlink Circlet (Mk I) [hybrid]
You can telepathically communicate with any creatures within 30 feet with which you share a language. This functions like a shirren’s *limited telepathy* racial trait.

#### Psychic booster [hybrid]
This circlet, originally designed by lashuntas, fits over the wearer’s brow and wraps around the wearer’s antennae (if any). A psychic booster augments the power of your inherent psychic abilities. If you have telepathy, the range of your telepathy doubles. (For instance, if you have limited telepathy out to a range of 30 feet, the range increases from 30 feet to 60 feet.)

#### Serum of Appearance Change
Upon drinking this elixir, your coloration and the general form of your features instantly and permanently changes. Within the range that is normal for your race and sex, you can select any skin tone, hair and eye color, and alter the nature of such things as the shape or your nose or chin, the length of your fingers, broadness of your frame, and so on. You are still recognizable as yourself unless you attempt a Charisma (Deception) check to alter your features enough to conceal your identity. In no case can you take on the exact appearance of another creature (even with a Deception check; the level of control is not that fine).

#### Serum of Healing

:five: (equivalent to Healing Potion) You regain hit points when you drink this serum. The number of hit points depends on the potion's rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion's red liquid glimmers when agitated.

|Name|Rarity|HP restored|
|----|------|:---------:|
|Healing|Common|2d4 + 2|
|Greater healing|Uncommon|4d4 + 4|
|Superior healing|Rare|8d4 + 8|
|Supreme healing|Very rare|10d4 + 20|

#### Serum of Sex Shift
Mass production has rendered this once-rare serum easy and inexpensive to obtain among the Pact Worlds. Upon drinking this elixir, your biology instantly transforms to take on a set of sexual characteristics of your choice, changing both your appearance and physiology accordingly. You have some mild control over the details of this change, but you retain a strong “family resemblance” to your former appearance.

The elixir’s magic functions instantaneously and cannot be dispelled. Your new anatomy is as healthy and functional as your previous body’s, potentially allowing you to conceive, carry, or bear children (depending on your species’ biology). Drinking a second elixir of sex shift either reverts you back to a former form or allows you to adopt other sexual characteristics, as you choose. The elixir has no effect if you are unwilling, and the presence of certain sex-specific biological processes, such as gestation, may prevent this serum from taking effect.

#### Spell Ampoule
Spell ampoules are injectable magic, where the essence of a magic spell has been condensed into a liquid form and prepared for injection into a creature. Known colloquially as “spell amps,” these heady, ready-to-use magic injections can be used only once. A spell amp duplicates the effect of a beneficial spell excluding divination spells or spells that create some link between the caster and the target. In addition, the spell must be 3rd level or lower, have a casting time of 1 minute or less, and target one or more creatures (but not spells that target just the spellcaster). If a spell targets both creatures and objects, it only affects creatures when used as a spell amp. If a spell requires expending a Resolve Point to cast, it also requires the user to spend a Resolve Point when used as a spell amp (if you choose not to spend a Resolve Point or don’t have any Resolve Points remaining, the spell amp has no effect).

Creating a spell ampoule has the same requirements as creating a spell gem (see below).

You can only use a spell ampoule on yourself or a willing or unconscious creature. Injecting yourself or a willing creature with a spell ampoule is an action action, while injecting an unconscious creature is a full action. Spell amps take effect as if the spell had been cast upon the creature injected at the minimum level. When you are injected with a spell amp, you get to make any decisions about the spell’s effect as if you were the caster of the spell—you are both the effective target and the caster of the effect.

#### Spell Gem

Consisting of one or more lattices of carefully arranged lines of rare metal and bits of precious stone in a silicon casing, each lattice in a spell gem is encoded with magical writings equivalent to the casting of a single, specific spell. Holding a spell gem in your hand unlocks little-used portions of your mind, granting you the ability to temporarily cast the spell encoded within the gem without using up your daily spell slots. You must hold the spell gem in your hand throughout the spell’s casting time and must spend at least an action using the spell gem, even if the spell’s casting time is shorter. Each spell stored within a spell gem can be cast only once, after which the magic encoded within the spell gem’s lattice is forever expended.

Only spellcasters are capable of using spell gems—if you aren’t a spellcaster, you’re unable to make use of the knowledge that the gem unlocks. You don’t need to know the spell within a spell gem to use it, but the spell must be on your class’s spell list (or have otherwise been added to your spell list). If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. If you fail to cast a spell from a spell gem, the spell remains within the gem and you can attempt to use it again.

To craft a spell gem, you have to know the spell you’re encoding into the gem. If a spell requires expensive materials as part of its casting (such as *raise dead*), you must provide those while crafting the gem, and the gem’s price is increased by the price of the components. You can create larger, compound spell gems with multiple spells in multiple lattices, with a price equal to the total price of all spells stored within it. Such spell gems can be used to cast only one spell at a time.

#### Starstone compass [hybrid]

This small, clockwork navigational device hones in on mystical signals emitted by the Starstone resting at the heart of Absalom Station, calculating the compass’s precise distance from and direction relative to the enigmatic font. While you are in the Pact Worlds system, this device lets you automatically know which direction Absalom Station is in relation to your current location, and it grants you a +2 bonus to Intelligence (Piloting) checks when astrogating throughout the Pact Worlds system.
