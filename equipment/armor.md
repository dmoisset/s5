# Armor

Armor is usually the easiest and most cost-effective way for creatures to protect themselves. Whether you are skimming 
through space aboard a mercenary vessel, attending a diplomatic meeting on a space station, or descending to a planet’s 
surface to explore, armor provides you with protection against attacks and hostile environments.

Modern armor is made of many different substances, including carbon fiber, ceramic, fabric, metal, and polymers. Most are 
constructed from a combination of materials, and some even use archaic materials such as animal hide. Creatures wear armor 
to protect themselves, but also to express their personal style.

Most suits of armor consist of a helmet, gloves, boots, and a bodysuit that offers head-to-toe protection. Unless otherwise 
specified, the boots include a functionality that can anchor your feet to a solid surface in a zero-gravity environment, 
allowing you to orient yourself or return to normal footing when needed.

## Modern vs archaic armor

All armor is either “archaic” or “modern”

Any armor used from the Player's HAndbook or a similar medieval source is considered to have the “archaic” property, and can 
be used as normal. Being archaic makes it normally susceptible to archaic weapons. None of the armor described in this 
section is considered archaic, and as such, confers the user resistance to any damage caused by archaic weapons.

Modern armor has a minimum proficiency requirement. Using an armor with a proficiency requirement above your proficiency 
bonus has the same effect of using an armor your character is not proficient with.

Some modern armor provides an AC of 10+Dex, which is the same as an unarmored character. Nonetheless wearing that armor can 
be useful because of the environmental protection that an armor provides, and the possible upgrades that can be applied to 
an armor suit.

All modern armor includes, unless specified otherwise:
* A personal communication device
* Boots that allow you anchoring to a surface in zero-g (this isn’t strong enough to hold your weight in normal gravity)

## Environmental Protection

Space can be an inhospitable place, with countless dangerous worlds within it. Unless otherwise specified, all modern armors 
protect you from a range of hazards to ensure that you can survive for at least a few days if you must make emergency 
repairs to the hull of a starship, explore an alien world, or endure exposure to an environmental breach in a space station. 
Some armors do this through an environmental field (a minor force field specially attuned to pressure and temperature that 
does not reduce damage from attacks), while others can be closed with helmets and airtight seals.

### Activating and deactivating

A suit of armor’s environmental protections last for a number of days equal to minumum proficiency bonus × 4 - 6. 
Activating or deactivating these environmental protections takes an action. If you have access to a suit that is unattended 
or worn by a helpless creature, you can turn on its environmental protection, but turning it off requires a Computers check 
to hack the system with a DC of 13+minimum proficiency.

The duration of a suit’s environmental protections does not need to be expended all at once, but it must be expended in 1-
hour increments. Recharging this duration requires access to a functioning starship or an environment recharging station 
(publicly available in most technologically advanced or average settlements) and takes 1 minute per day recharged. Most of 
the recharging stations that replenish devices, such as batteries and power cells, also recharge armor’s environmental 
protections, and using them to recharge suits is typically free of price. All other functions on a suit of armor with no 
duration remaining still work normally.

### Breathing and pressure

All modern armor can facilitate self-contained breathing, protecting you against vacuums, smoke, and thick, thin, and toxic 
atmospheres (including any airborne poison or disease). Self-contained breathing functions underwater and in similar liquid 
environments. This protection allows you to breathe in a corrosive atmosphere to prevent suffocation, but it isn’t strong 
enough to prevent a corrosive atmosphere from dealing acid damage to both you and your armor. A suit of armor with an 
upgrade that grants acid resistance reduces any acid damage taken from a corrosive atmosphere normally. Any vision 
impairment from the environment (such as smoke or water) still applies.

### Radiation

While wearing any modern armor, you are considered to be exposed to radiation one level lighter than the area you are in (no 
radiation for an area with light radiation). If the minimum proficiency of the armor is at least +4, the radiation is 
reduced by a total of 2 levels.

### Temperature

Armor’s environmental protections reasonably protect you against both cold (temperatures below 0° F / -15° C) and heat (air 
temperatures over 100° F / 35° C). This prevents you from having to attempt Constitution saving throws to avoid exhaustion 
from the environment. This does not protect against cold or fire damage from other sources or against environments that deal 
damage without allowing a Constitution saving throw or breathing the atmosphere (such as lava).

## Upgrade slots

Modern armor can have a number of slots where certain technological and magical upgrades can be installed. The modern armor 
table indicates how many of these slots the armor has. Some armor upgrades are larger or more complicated and take up 
multiple upgrade slots.

Armor upgrades also have a minimum proficiency. You can not install an upgrade in an armor with a lower minimum proficiency 
than the upgrade (i.e., an upgrade with a +4 minimum proficiency can not be installed into an armor with a +3 minimum 
proficiency).

## Resistances

Some modern armor confer resistances to a specific type of damage when worn. This can include certain damage types (for 
example, “slashing”) or weapon categories (for  example “laser, plasma” means that the armor provides resistance against 
damage coming from laser or plasma weapons).
