# Armor upgrades

A creature can personalize armor by purchasing and installing armor upgrades, described below, which add bonuses or 
customized abilities to armor. Some individuals keep a collection of upgrades at hand, swapping them out as needed (requiring 
10 minutes to replace the unit and resecure all connections). Explanations of entries for upgrades’ statistics follow.

Some armor upgrades require power, indicating a “Capacity”. This value indicates the largest battery that the upgrade can 
hold. Some upgrades can be magical and had their own recharge rules (like auto-recharge per day, or no recharge). These 
upgrades also indicate an “usage” value which says how many charges are spent per each use.

Upgrades are fitted into the armor upgrade slots. A few upgrades use more than one slot

#### Automated Loader

This device attaches to powered armor and consists of a small robotic arm and a storage compartment that holds up to 2 bulk 
of ammunition and batteries. You can activate the automated loader as a bonus action to reload or recharge a weapon that’s 
mounted to the powered armor (but not to replace the batteries of the powered armor itself). Doing this doesn’t require free 
hands. Abilities that let you reload faster don’t apply to an automated loader.

#### Backup Generator

You can connect charged electric items such as batteries to this miniature generator to recharge them. The electricity comes 
from the kinetic energy of your movement, which generates 1 charge every 10 minutes of movement. No more than one item can be 
plugged in at a time, and the generator doesn’t produce charges when you’re resting or otherwise stationary.

#### Deflective Reinforcement

This upgrade gives your armor a uniquely slippery texture. While wearing this armor, any piercing, slashing or bludgeoning damage that you take from non-magical weapons is reduced by 3. This does not stack with other effects that reduced your damaged by a fixed amount. In addition, you gain advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to escape from grapples.

#### Electrostatic Field

This field over your armor grants you electricity resistance, and any creature that touches you or deals damage to you with a melee weapon takes electricity damage. The  damage dealt depend on this upgrade’s type, as noted below:

* Mk 1: 1d6 electricity damage.
* Mk 2: 2d6 electricity damage.
* Mk 3: 3d6 electricity damage.

#### Exit Pod

This body harness fits into a suit of powered armor or is built into the frame of heavy armor, allowing you to exit the armor 
as an action. Entering the armor is no faster with an exit pod.

#### Filtered Rebreather

This upgraded rebreather supplements your armor’s ability to provide fresh air and filters out common toxins and poisonous vapors. Armor with this upgrade can provide fresh air for a number of weeks equal to its level. You also gain acid resistance and are always considered proficient in saving throws against poison and disease.

#### Force Field (Usage: 1 charge/round)

You can activate or deactivate your armor’s force field as an action. Once active, the device generates an invisible force 
field around you, including all your worn and carried items. The force field blocks solids and liquids but not gases or light 
(including laser beams). You can breathe while the field is active, but you can’t eat or drink. While a force field is 
active, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points depending on the force field’s power. All damage dealt to you is subtracted 
from the force field’s temporary Hit Points first. A force field has fast healing, meaning that it regains temporary Hit 
Points at a fixed rate each round at the end of your turn, up to its normal maximum. If the force field’s temporary Hit 
Points are reduced to 0, it is inactive until the end of your next turn, when its fast healing restores some of its Hit 
Points. The charge capacity, amount of temporary Hit Points granted, and rate of fast healing vary according to the force 
field’s color code. A suit of armor cannot support more than one force field upgrade. 

|Color|Capacity|Temp HP|Fast Healing|
|-----|-------:|------:|-----------:|
|Brown|10|1|1|
|Purple|10|5|2|
|Black|10|10|3|
|White|20|15|4|
|Gray|20|20|5|
|Green|20|25|6|
|Red|40|30|7|
|Blue|40|35|8|
|Orange|40|40|9|
|Prismatic|100|50|10|

#### Forcepack (Hybrid; Usage: 2 charges/round; Capacity 100)

A *forcepack* grants a fly speed of 60 feet. You can use this for cruising flight at a usage of 1 charge per minute, or for combat at 1 charge per turn. Switching between modes is an action. While in cruising flight mode, you ahve disadvantage to attacks and Dexterity saves, and attacks against you have advantage. a *forcepack can't lift you if you're encumberred.

#### Haste Circuit (Magic; Usage: 1 charge/round; Capacity: 5)

You can activate the haste circuit as a bonus action to gain the benefits of a *haste* spell until you spend another bonus action to deactivate it or it runs out of charges. A haste circuit’s magical charges replenish each day.

#### Infrared Sensors

This upgrade gives you darkvision up to 60 feet.

#### Jetpack (Usage: 2 charges/round; Capacity 40)

This battery powered upgrade gives you a fly speed of 30 feet. You can use this for “cruising flight” at a usage of only 1 charge per minute, but you can not make attacks and attacks against you have disadvantage while doing so. Changing from normal flight to cruising flight or vice versa is an action. A jetpack can’t lift you if you’re encumbered.

#### Jump Jets (Usage: 2 charges/action; Capacity 20)

You can activate jump jets as part of your movement in order to fly during your movement. You can fly up to 30 feet with a
maximum height of 10 feet, or you can fly up to 20 feet straight up. You must land at the end of your movement (if you don’t,
you fall). Jump jets can’t lift you if you’re encumbered.

#### Load Lifter

This set of artificial muscles increases the amount of bulk you can carry while wearing your armor by 3.

#### Phase Shield (Usage: 2 charges/round; Capacity 40)

You can activate this upgrade to generate a glowing, translucent blue shield on one of your arms that helps you block incoming attacks. Activating or deactivating the shield takes a bonus action. While the shield is active, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. The phase shield interferes with your ability to use the arm it’s installed on, so while the phase shield is active, you can hold an item in that hand but not use it or make attacks with it.

#### Quick Release Sheath

This articulated compartment can hold a one-handed weapon of no more than light bulk. You can activate this upgrade as a
bonus action to put the item in your hand as though you’d drawn it.

#### Radiation Buffer

This device grants you advantage to your initial saving throw against radiation in addition to any bonuses from your armor’s
environmental protection. This doesn’t provide any bonus to saves against the secondary effects of radiation.

#### Sonic Dampener

This device muffles the incidental sounds you make, and sonic attacks lose power in your vicinity. You gain sonic resistance and your armor doesn't inflict disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

#### Targeting Computer

This targeting computer helps you compensate for poor visibility conditions. In heavily obscured areas you are still aware of 
which squares within 5 feet of you are used by enemies.

#### Tensile Reinforcement

When treating your armor as an object for the purpose of damaging it directly, it’s considered to have +2 to AC and 
resistance to all damage. This doesn’t affect your AC while wearing the armor.

#### Thermal Capacitor

This upgrade regulates heat, protecting you from extreme temperatures. You can exist comfortably in conditions between –50° and 75° C without needing to attempt Constitution saves.

A Mk 2 thermal capacitor provides either fire or cold resistance (decided when manufacturing the upgrade).

A Mk 3 thermal capacitor provides both fire and cold resistance.
