# Armor upgrades

A creature can personalize armor by purchasing and installing armor upgrades, described below, which add bonuses or customized abilities to armor. Some individuals keep a collection of upgrades at hand, swapping them out as needed (requiring 10 minutes to replace the unit and resecure all connections). Explanations of entries for upgrades’ statistics follow.

Some armor upgrades require power, indicating a “Capacity”. This value indicates the largest battery that the upgrade can hold. Some upgrades can be magical and had their own recharge rules (like auto-recharge per day, or no recharge). These upgrades also indicate an “usage” value which says how many charges are spent per each use.

Upgrades are fitted into the armor upgrade slots. A few upgrades use more than one slot
