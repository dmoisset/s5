# Armor upgrades

A creature can personalize armor by purchasing and installing armor upgrades, described below, which add bonuses or 
customized abilities to armor. Some individuals keep a collection of upgrades at hand, swapping them out as needed (requiring 
10 minutes to replace the unit and resecure all connections). Explanations of entries for upgrades’ statistics follow.

Some armor upgrades require power, indicating a “Capacity”. This value indicates the largest battery that the upgrade can 
hold. Some upgrades can be magical and had their own recharge rules (like auto-recharge per day, or no recharge). These 
upgrades also indicate an “usage” value which says how many charges are spent per each use.

Upgrades are fitted into the armor upgrade slots. A few upgrades use more than one slot

#### Automated Loader

This device attaches to powered armor and consists of a small robotic arm and a storage compartment that holds up to 2 bulk 
of ammunition and batteries. You can activate the automated loader as a bonus action to reload or recharge a weapon that’s 
mounted to the powered armor (but not to replace the batteries of the powered armor itself). Doing this doesn’t require free 
hands. Abilities that let you reload faster don’t apply to an automated loader.

#### Backup Generator

You can connect charged electric items such as batteries to this miniature generator to recharge them. The electricity comes 
from the kinetic energy of your movement, which generates 1 charge every 10 minutes of movement. No more than one item can be 
plugged in at a time, and the generator doesn’t produce charges when you’re resting or otherwise stationary.

#### Exit Pod

This body harness fits into a suit of powered armor or is built into the frame of heavy armor, allowing you to exit the armor 
as an action. Entering the armor is no faster with an exit pod.

#### Force Field (Usage: 1 charge/round)

You can activate or deactivate your armor’s force field as an action. Once active, the device generates an invisible force 
field around you, including all your worn and carried items. The force field blocks solids and liquids but not gases or light 
(including laser beams). You can breathe while the field is active, but you can’t eat or drink. While a force field is 
active, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points depending on the force field’s power. All damage dealt to you is subtracted 
from the force field’s temporary Hit Points first. A force field has fast healing, meaning that it regains temporary Hit 
Points at a fixed rate each round at the end of your turn, up to its normal maximum. If the force field’s temporary Hit 
Points are reduced to 0, it is inactive until the end of your next turn, when its fast healing restores some of its Hit 
Points. The charge capacity, amount of temporary Hit Points granted, and rate of fast healing vary according to the force 
field’s color code. A suit of armor cannot support more than one force field upgrade. 

|Color|Capacity|Temp HP|Fast Healing|
|-----|-------:|------:|-----------:|
|Brown|10|1|1|
|Purple|10|5|2|
|Black|10|10|3|
|White|20|15|4|
|Gray|20|20|5|
|Green|20|25|6|
|Red|40|30|7|
|Blue|40|35|8|
|Orange|40|40|9|
|Prismatic|100|50|10|

#### Infrared Sensors

This upgrade gives you darkvision up to 60 feet.

#### Jump Jets

You can activate jump jets as part of your movement in order to fly during your movement. You can fly up to 30 feet with a 
maximum height of 10 feet, or you can fly up to 20 feet straight up. You must land at the end of your movement (if you don’t, 
you fall). Jump jets can’t lift you if you’re encumbered.

#### Quick Release Sheath

This articulated compartment can hold a one-handed weapon of no more than light bulk. You can activate this upgrade as a 
bonus action to put the item in your hand as though you’d drawn it.

#### Radiation Buffer

This device grants you advantage to your initial saving throw against radiation in addition to any bonuses from your armor’s 
environmental protection. This doesn’t provide any bonus to saves against the secondary effects of radiation.

#### Targeting Computer

This targeting computer helps you compensate for poor visibility conditions. In heavily obscured areas you are still aware of 
which squares within 5 feet of you are used by enemies.

#### Tensile Reinforcement

When treating your armor as an object for the purpose of damaging it directly, it’s considered to have +2 to AC and 
resistance to all damage. This doesn’t affect your AC while wearing the armor.
