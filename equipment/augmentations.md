# Augmentations

Many explorers and mercenaries modify their own bodies with technological or biological gear called augmentations. These are modifications to your body that give you special abilities and bonuses. Once installed, they become a part of your body and generally can’t be affected by abilities that destroy or disable objects or target technological items or creatures. As far as attacks and abilities are concerned, a cybernetic or vat-grown arm is no more (or less) vulnerable than your original biological limb. 

**Activation:** Most augmentations work continuously. Those requiring some degree of control are plugged into your nervous system, and you can turn them on or off as an action unless otherwise noted. For example, you could activate or deactivate cybernetics in your eyes to observe different visual phenomena.

**Systems:** All augmentations have a system entry indicating the part of the body into which it must be installed. You can’t have more than one augmentation on the same part of your body. Most augmentations require installation into one of the following body systems: *arm* (or all arms), *brain*, *ears*, *eyes*, *foot* (or all feet), *hand* (or all hands), *heart*, *leg* (or all legs), *lungs*, *spinal column*, *skin*, and *throat*.

## Cybernetics

Cybernetic augmentations use machines and circuitry integrated with the flesh and bone of the recipient. In most cases, cybernetics must be installed into the body by a trained surgeon—a process that takes 2 hour to a day (depending on the complexity of the augmentation) and the price of which is covered in the price of the cybernetic. Cybernetics are more than just machine implants: they are complex meldings of technology and the living host’s own organs. This allows them to be hardened against assaults that affect other technologies in ways robots and other entirely technological creatures can’t. Cybernetics are not subject to any effect or attack that targets technology unless it specifies that it affects cybernetics.

### Symple cybernetics

The following cybernetic augmentations can be installed in 2 hours at any city clinic:

|Name|Price|System|
|----|----:|------|
|Darkvision capacitors, standard|1750|Eyes|
|Datajack, standard|625|Brain|
|Hideaway Limb, standard|150|Arm or leg|
|Prosthetic Limb, standard|100|Arm+hand or leg+foot|
|Prosthetic Limb, storage|1450|Arm+hand or leg+foot|
|Respiration Compounder|250|Lungs|
|Retinal Reflectors|1350|Eyes|
|Speed Suspension, minimal|1900|All legs|
|Vocal Modulator|125|Throat|

#### Darkvision capacitors, standard
These replacement eyes allow you to see in total darkness, giving you darkvision with a range of 60 feet. They operate by sending out low-powered ultraviolet lasers that are then detected by receptors within the capacitors. When your capacitors are in operation, their lasers can be detected by creatures that have darkvision capacitors or can otherwise see ultraviolet light.

#### Datajack, standard
This cybernetic includes a programmable data port that allows you to access different types of computers and digital storage media. Having the system connected directly to your nervous system obviates the need for an interface to access data on a system. Actually operating the system requires you to use the Computers skill as usual. Some closed systems don’t allow data access or require you to do some rewiring to connect with a datajack (usually an Intelligence (Engineering) check).

#### Hideaway Limb, Standard
This compartment is hidden inside one of your limbs. You can conceal items inside and protect them with a simple passcode. The compartment can hold items of negligible bulk and items of light bulk that are either relatively small or can be folded or contracted to fit. A hideaway in a leg (in a human) can hold more than one in an arm, and the creature’s size also adjusts the capacity. The GM decides what can fit.

When the compartment is closed, the seam in your flesh is difficult to detect. You have advantage in Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to conceal items in a hideaway limb. Though this compartment can usually foil a simple pat down, most security checkpoints include a scan that can detect such devices.

#### Prosthetic Limb, standard
This prosthesis replaces a missing limb. It restores functionality, but it is no more durable than and doesn’t otherwise function differently than a normal limb for your species. A prosthetic limb can replace one you’ve lost, or you can have a limb removed in order to replace it with a prosthetic.

#### Prosthetic Limb, storage
This storage prosthetic limb has a built-in concealed storage compartment, which functions as a hideaway limb (see above).

#### Respiration Compounder
A respiration compounder consists of a series of modules that attach to your lungs, letting you survive longer without having to breathe. The time you can hold your breath, and the time you can survive without air, is doubled. This doesn’t protect you from other dangers of an airless environment. The compounder also filters your air, granting advantage to saving throws vs inhaled poisons or other airborne toxins.

#### Retinal Reflectors
These sheets of reflective material can be implanted behind the retina, negating the disadvantages of dim light (but they do not allow you to see in darkness)

#### Speed Suspension, minimal
You increase your land speed by replacing joints and tendons in your legs with high-performance cybernetics. A minimal speed suspension replaces only a few parts, increasing your land speed by 10 feet. 

#### Vocal Modulator
A vocal modulator includes a series of miniature actuators built specifically to reshape your voice box, along with miniature hyper-resonant chambers that dynamically close or open. This allows you to change the pitch, timbre, and tone of your voice. You can more easily imitate accents or pronounce alien languages. This can be used as the “mimic speech” ability of the Actor feat 

## Biotech

Functioning similarly to cybernetics, biotech items include modifications to your DNA combined with implants of biological origin that integrate into your physiology. Biotech mostly operates by the same rules as cybernetics and uses the same implantation slots.

### Simple Biotech

The following biotech augmentations can be installed in 2 hours at any city clinic:

|Name|Price|System|
|----|----:|------|
|Adaptive Biochains|special|special|
|Climbing suckers|1200|All feet|
|Dragon gland, wyrmling|755|Throat|
|Gill sheath|95|Lungs|
|Tympanal Cluster|2150|Ears|
|Venom Spur|625|Hand|
|WildWise|500|Throat|

#### Adaptive Biochains
These can replicate biologically the effect of any cybernetics, with 10% extra cost.

#### Climbing suckers
The soles of your feet become covered in fleshy slats you can open and close, providing you a climb speed of 20 feet. You don’t need to attempt Strength (Athletics) checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). You don’t benefit from climbing suckers unless you’re barefoot or wearing custom clothing, and you can not be wearing more than light armor. Climbing suckers integrate into your natural feet and do not require you to replace your feet and legs. Climbing suckers can be installed into the feet of prosthetic legs.

#### Dragon gland, wyrmling
You implant a dragonborn gland modified to function for a creature of your race at the back of your throat. You can trigger this gland as an action to expel a breath weapon in a 15- foot cone, dealing 3d6 damage. Choose the damage type when the organ is biocrafted, picking from the following list: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You are not harmed by using your own breath weapon. Once you’ve used your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you’ve taken a short or long rest. You can also spend 1 Resolve Point at any point to recharge it immediately.

#### Gill sheath
An external lining striated with oxygen-filtering nodules coats the outside of your lungs. If you breathe in water, it filters into the lining, where the nodules extract the oxygen and deposit it into your lungs. This lets you breathe underwater or in the air. You still exhale normally.

#### Tympanal Cluster
A tympanal cluster consists of multiple small membranes of various sizes that can detect a wide range of sounds. They give you advantage in hearing-based Wisdom (Perception) checks (and as such increases your passive perception by +5 only for audible events).

#### Venom Spur
You implant a retractable stinger and venom sac into your hand. You can extend this stinger as a bonus action but only while you aren’t holding anything in that hand. Attacks with your stinger deal 1d6 piercing damage and automatically inject venom into the target. An affected creature can attempt a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) to resist the effects of your venom. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 poison damage immediately and must attempt a new Constitution saving throw at the start of its turn each round to end the effect. Each time it fails this save, it takes an additional 2d6 poison damage. Effects such as remove affliction and antitoxin affect this venom as though it were a poison.
Once used, the venom sac doesn’t refill until the next time you take a short or long rest. While it’s empty, you can still attack with the stinger but can’t envenomate your target.

#### WildWise
The soft purple fungus called wildwise attaches itself to your vocal cords and extends fine filaments into portions of your brain. It allows you to communicate in a general sense with beasts with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. You can attempt Charisma (Persuasion) checks to influence such creatures as well as understand in very vague terms information they try to convey to you. The information they give you usually consists of simple concepts such as “danger,” “food,” or “that way.”
