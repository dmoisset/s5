# Augmentations

Many explorers and mercenaries modify their own bodies with technological or biological gear called augmentations. These are modifications to your body that give you special abilities and bonuses. Once installed, they become a part of your body and generally can’t be affected by abilities that destroy or disable objects or target technological items or creatures. As far as attacks and abilities are concerned, a cybernetic or vat-grown arm is no more (or less) vulnerable than your original biological limb. 

**Activation:** Most augmentations work continuously. Those requiring some degree of control are plugged into your nervous system, and you can turn them on or off as an action unless otherwise noted. For example, you could activate or deactivate cybernetics in your eyes to observe different visual phenomena.

**Systems:** All augmentations have a system entry indicating the part of the body into which it must be installed. You can’t have more than one augmentation on the same part of your body. Most augmentations require installation into one of the following body systems: *arm* (or all arms), *brain*, *ears*, *eyes*, *foot* (or all feet), *hand* (or all hands), *heart*, *leg* (or all legs), *lungs*, *spinal column*, *skin*, and *throat*.

## Cybernetics

Cybernetic augmentations use machines and circuitry integrated with the flesh and bone of the recipient. In most cases, cybernetics must be installed into the body by a trained surgeon—a process that takes 2 hour to a day (depending on the complexity of the augmentation) and the price of which is covered in the price of the cybernetic. Cybernetics are more than just machine implants: they are complex meldings of technology and the living host’s own organs. This allows them to be hardened against assaults that affect other technologies in ways robots and other entirely technological creatures can’t. Cybernetics are not subject to any effect or attack that targets technology unless it specifies that it affects cybernetics.

### Simple cybernetics

The following cybernetic augmentations can be installed in 2 hours at any city clinic:

|Name|Price|System|
|----|----:|------|
|Darkvision capacitors, standard|1750|Eyes|
|Datajack, standard|625|Brain|
|Hideaway Limb, standard|150|Arm or leg|
|Prosthetic Limb, standard|100|Arm+hand or leg+foot|
|Prosthetic Limb, storage|1450|Arm+hand or leg+foot|
|Respiration Compounder|250|Lungs|
|Retinal Reflectors|1350|Eyes|
|Speed Suspension, minimal|1900|All legs|
|Vocal Modulator|125|Throat|

#### Darkvision capacitors, standard

These replacement eyes allow you to see in total darkness, giving you darkvision with a range of 60 feet. They operate by sending out low-powered ultraviolet lasers that are then detected by receptors within the capacitors. When your capacitors are in operation, their lasers can be detected by creatures that have darkvision capacitors or can otherwise see ultraviolet light.

#### Datajack, standard

This cybernetic includes a programmable data port that allows you to access different types of computers and digital storage media. Having the system connected directly to your nervous system obviates the need for an interface to access data on a system. Actually operating the system requires you to use the Computers skill as usual. Some closed systems don’t allow data access or require you to do some rewiring to connect with a datajack (usually an Intelligence (Engineering) check).

#### Hideaway Limb, Standard

This compartment is hidden inside one of your limbs. You can conceal items inside and protect them with a simple passcode. The compartment can hold items of negligible bulk and items of light bulk that are either relatively small or can be folded or contracted to fit. A hideaway in a leg (in a human) can hold more than one in an arm, and the creature’s size also adjusts the capacity. The GM decides what can fit.

When the compartment is closed, the seam in your flesh is difficult to detect. You have advantage in Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to conceal items in a hideaway limb. Though this compartment can usually foil a simple pat down, most security checkpoints include a scan that can detect such devices.

#### Prosthetic Limb, standard

This prosthesis replaces a missing limb. It restores functionality, but it is no more durable than and doesn’t otherwise function differently than a normal limb for your species. A prosthetic limb can replace one you’ve lost, or you can have a limb removed in order to replace it with a prosthetic.

#### Prosthetic Limb, storage

This storage prosthetic limb has a built-in concealed storage compartment, which functions as a hideaway limb (see above).

#### Respiration Compounder

A respiration compounder consists of a series of modules that attach to your lungs, letting you survive longer without having to breathe. The time you can hold your breath, and the time you can survive without air, is doubled. This doesn’t protect you from other dangers of an airless environment. The compounder also filters your air, granting advantage to saving throws vs inhaled poisons or other airborne toxins.

#### Retinal Reflectors

These sheets of reflective material can be implanted behind the retina, negating the disadvantages of dim light (but they do not allow you to see in darkness)

#### Speed Suspension, minimal

You increase your land speed by replacing joints and tendons in your legs with high-performance cybernetics. A minimal speed suspension replaces only a few parts, increasing your land speed by 10 feet. 

#### Vocal Modulator

A vocal modulator includes a series of miniature actuators built specifically to reshape your voice box, along with miniature hyper-resonant chambers that dynamically close or open. This allows you to change the pitch, timbre, and tone of your voice. You can more easily imitate accents or pronounce alien languages. This can be used as the “mimic speech” ability of the Actor feat 

### Minor cybernetics

The following cybernetic augmentations require an 8 hour procedure at a health centre. Installation requires anaesthetics and medical control, during that period, but you can walk out by the end of the process with no risk or side-effects

|Name|Price|System|
|----|----:|------|
|Cardiac accelerator|3850|Heart|
|Darkvision capacitors, advanced|9000|Eyes|
|Datajack, accelerated|8525|Brain|
|Datajack, high-density|2600|Brain|
|Dermal plating, mk 1|3025|Skin|
|Dermal plating, mk 2|6950|Skin|
|Hideaway limb, quickdraw|3050|Arm|
|Speed suspension, standard|8800|All legs|
|Wide-spectrum ocular implant|2825|Eyes|

#### Cardiac accelerator

This implant plugs directly into your heart and can be triggered to overclock the performance of your heart and circulatory system. When you run, charge, or move, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to increase your speed (in the relevant mode of movement) by 20 feet for that turn.

Alternatively, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction when you attempt a Dexterity saving throw to gain a +1d4 bonus to your roll.

#### Darkvision capacitors, advanced

These provide the benefits of [Darkvision capacitors, standard](#darkvision-capacitors-standard) and [Wide-spectrum ocular implant](#wide-spectrum-ocular-implant) at the same time.

#### Datajack, accelerated

This works similar to a [Datajack, standard](#datajack-standard), but also provides a bonus of +1d6 to Intelligence (Computers) check while using it.

#### Datajack, high-density

This works similar to a [Datajack, standard](#datajack-standard), but also provides a bonus of +1d4 to Intelligence (Computers) check while using it.

#### Dermal plating

You line your skin with hardened composite plates that deflect physical attacks (dealing piercing, slashing or bludgeoning damage). Damage is reduced by an amount that depends on the model of your dermal plating (1 for Mk 1, 2 for Mk 2, etc.). This reduction does not stack with other effects that reduce damage by a fixed amount.

#### Hideaway limb, quickdraw

This works like a [Hideaway limb, standard](#hideaway-limb-standard). You can install a one-handed weapon in the compartment that can pop-up and attack without needing to be held. You can not use your arm for other purposes in the same turn that you're using it to attack in this way. Attempts to disarm this weapon have disadvantage. While storing a weapon like this, you can't hide other objects, there's only room for the weapon.

#### Speed suspension, standard

You increase your land speed by replacing joints and tendons in your legs with high-performance cybernetics. A standard suspension is more invasive than the minimal and increases your land speed by 20 feet.

#### Wide-spectrum ocular implant

These cybernetic spheres replace your eyes entirely. A dimly lit area is no longer considered lightly obscured to you (so you no longer take penalties to Wisdom (Perception) checks) and you get the ability to see infrared and ultraviolet light. In normal light you gain advantage to Wisdom (Perception) checks based on sight and allow you to notice some things people who can see only the red-violet light spectrum can’t, including the lasers from darkvision capacitors. This doesn’t grant you darkvision, but in darkness you can see significant sources of heat due to your infrared vision.

### Moderate Cybernetics

The following cybernetic augmentations require an 12 hour procedure at a health centre. Installation requires anaesthetics and medical control, during that period, and you gain a level of exhaustion after surgery.

|Name|Price|System|
|----|----:|------|
|Dermal plating, mk 3|17,975|Skin|
|Cybernetic arm, Single|24,750|Spinal column|
|Dermal plating, mk 4|48,850|Skin|
|Speed suspension, complete|32,900|All legs|

#### Cybernetic arm, Single

Made of ultralight materials, this fully cybernetic arm fuses to your spinal column, exoskeleton, or equivalent body structure and functions as a full arm. You can hold an additional hand’s worth of equipment. This lets you have more items at the ready, but it doesn’t increase the number of attacks you can make in combat. You must have a Strength score of 12 to use a cybernetic arm effectively.

#### Speed suspension, complete

You increase your land speed by replacing joints and tendons in your legs with high-performance cybernetics. A complete suspension is more invasive than the standard and increases your land speed by 30 feet.

### Major Cybernetics

The following cybernetic augmentations require a 24-hour stay at a hospital. Installation requires anaesthetics and medical control, during that period, and you gain two levels of exhaustion after surgery.

|Name|Price|System|
|----|----:|------|
|Darkvision capacitors, long-range|48,950|Eyes|
|Cybernetic arm, Dual|70,150|Spinal column|
|Dermal plating, mk 5|105,000|Skin|
|Polyhand|71,1000|Hand|
|Dermal plating, mk 6|163,500|Skin|

#### Darkvision capacitors, long-range

These operate like the advanced darkvision capacitors, but with a range of 120 feet.

#### Cybernetic arm, Dual

This adds two arms similar to the Cybernetic arm, single. Dual cybernetic arms consist of a pair of arms, one on each
side of your body, and let you hold two additional hands’ worth of equipment. You need a Strength score of 14 to use dual
cybernetic arms effectively.

#### Polyhand

You replace your entire hand with a hand made of reprogrammable microscopic adamantine prisms. With either a mental command or a programmable interface built into the hand, you can reconfigure your hand into the shape of various tools. The hand can contain programming for nine different tools, in addition to a configuration for a normal hand for your species. As a bonus action, you can switch the setting, causing the adamantine pieces to realign into the shape of the chosen tool. The tool has all the flexibility of the normal tool (or of a hand, if set to that).

Programming a new tool into the polyhand takes 10 minutes, and you must choose either to fill an empty slot or to replace a programmed tool. The tool replicated must be of min proficiency of +3 or lower. The polyhand can replicate the moving parts of a tool, but you must supply any fuel or batteries needed for the tool to function. The tool cannot produce substances, and since it’s not very conductive (important so as to avoid shocking the user), it can’t serve as a power conduit or data transmission line. The GM has final say in deciding which tools you can duplicate. The tools within engineering kits and similar kits can be duplicated, subject to the restrictions above.

You can’t replace the hand setting based on your biology, which is required for the polyhand to function properly. You can add a hand corresponding to another species in any slot that isn’t reserved; for instance, a human could program her polyhand to replicate a shirren hand. This can’t duplicate features of a unique individual, such as thumbprints. You can install a polyhand into a prosthetic limb that replaces an arm as if the prosthetic were a natural arm.

The adamantine construction makes the polyhand extremely durable. This doesn’t change the amount of unarmed strike damage, no matter the form your polyhand is in. The polyhand can’t maintain structural integrity if extended too far, so it can’t assume a form more than one and a half feet long in any dimension. Consequently, it can’t extend your reach.


### Extensive Cybernetics

The following cybernetic augmentations require a 48-hour stay at a hospital. Installation requires anaesthetics and medical control, during that period, and you gain two levels of exhaustion after surgery, and take 3d12 damage directly to your hit points once the procedure is over.

|Name|Price|System|
|----|----:|------|
|Dermal plating, mk 7|542,000|Skin|

## Biotech

Functioning similarly to cybernetics, biotech items include modifications to your DNA combined with implants of biological origin that integrate into your physiology. Biotech mostly operates by the same rules as cybernetics and uses the same implantation slots.

### Simple Biotech

The following biotech augmentations can be installed in 2 hours at any city clinic:

|Name|Price|System|
|----|----:|------|
|Adaptive Biochains|special|special|
|Climbing suckers|1200|All feet|
|Dragon gland, wyrmling|755|Throat|
|Gill sheath|95|Lungs|
|Tympanal Cluster|2150|Ears|
|Venom Spur|625|Hand|
|WildWise|500|Throat|

#### Adaptive Biochains
These can replicate biologically the effect of any cybernetics, with 10% extra cost.

#### Climbing suckers
The soles of your feet become covered in fleshy slats you can open and close, providing you a climb speed of 20 feet. You don’t need to attempt Strength (Athletics) checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). You don’t benefit from climbing suckers unless you’re barefoot or wearing custom clothing, and you can not be wearing more than light armor. Climbing suckers integrate into your natural feet and do not require you to replace your feet and legs. Climbing suckers can be installed into the feet of prosthetic legs.

#### Dragon gland, wyrmling
You implant a dragonborn gland modified to function for a creature of your race at the back of your throat. You can trigger this gland as an action to expel a breath weapon in a 15- foot cone, dealing 3d6 damage. Choose the damage type when the organ is biocrafted, picking from the following list: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You are not harmed by using your own breath weapon. Once you’ve used your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you’ve taken a short or long rest. You can also spend 1 Resolve Point at any point to recharge it immediately.

Targets in the area can attempt a Dexterity save (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) to take only half damage.

#### Gill sheath
An external lining striated with oxygen-filtering nodules coats the outside of your lungs. If you breathe in water, it filters into the lining, where the nodules extract the oxygen and deposit it into your lungs. This lets you breathe underwater or in the air. You still exhale normally.

#### Tympanal Cluster
A tympanal cluster consists of multiple small membranes of various sizes that can detect a wide range of sounds. They give you advantage in hearing-based Wisdom (Perception) checks (and as such increases your passive perception by +5 only for audible events).

#### Venom Spur
You implant a retractable stinger and venom sac into your hand. You can extend this stinger as a bonus action but only while you aren’t holding anything in that hand. Attacks with your stinger deal 1d6 piercing damage and automatically inject venom into the target. An affected creature can attempt a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) to resist the effects of your venom. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 poison damage immediately and must attempt a new Constitution saving throw at the start of its turn each round to end the effect. Each time it fails this save, it takes an additional 2d6 poison damage. Effects such as remove affliction and antitoxin affect this venom as though it were a poison.
Once used, the venom sac doesn’t refill until the next time you take a short or long rest. While it’s empty, you can still attack with the stinger but can’t envenomate your target.

#### WildWise
The soft purple fungus called wildwise attaches itself to your vocal cords and extends fine filaments into portions of your brain. It allows you to communicate in a general sense with beasts with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. You can attempt Charisma (Persuasion) checks to influence such creatures as well as understand in very vague terms information they try to convey to you. The information they give you usually consists of simple concepts such as “danger,” “food,” or “that way.”

## Minor Biotech

The following augmentations require an 8 hour procedure at a health centre. Installation requires anaesthetics and medical control, during that period, but you can walk out by the end of the process with no risk or side-effects

|Name|Price|System|
|----|----:|------|
|Skin of the Chameleon|4050|Skin|

#### Skin of the Chameleon

This biotech modification replaces pigmentation cells in your skin. You can alter your skin to mimic the terrain or lighting conditions around you, giving you advantage to Dexterity (Stealth) checks. You must be wearing custom clothing and no more than light armor to benefit from this biotech.

### Moderate Biotech

|Name|Price|System|
|----|----:|------|
|Dragon gland, standard|19,125|Throat|

#### Dragon gland, standard

This works like a dragon gland, wyrmling, but the damage increases to 9d6

### Major Biotech

### Extensive Biotech

|Name|Price|System|
|----|----:|------|
|Cleansing Breath|342,000|Lungs|

#### Cleansing Breath

Organic sacs implanted within your lungs cause you to exhale airborne antibodies and antitoxins. You and creatures breathing the same air within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against diseases and poisons.
