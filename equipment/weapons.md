# Weapons

An adventurer’s weapon can be all that stands between them and death. Weapons primarily deal damage, and some have additional special properties. Some weapons also cause specific critical hit effects, which are listed in the weapon tables and described below.

## Minimum Proficiency

As other Star5er equipment, modern weapons have a minimum proficiency requirement. Characters not meeting that proficiency 
requirement are not considered proficient with the weapon.

Some weapons have special effects that call for a saving throw or a skill check. The DC for those rolls is calculated as 
10+minimum proficiency. For example, to reduce damage from a grenade with minimum proficiency of +3, the target must succeed on 
a DC 13 (i.e. 10+3) Dexterity saving throw.

## Ammunition

Weapons often employ electrical charges (typically stored in batteries), cartridges of ammunition, or individual missiles. A weapon’s capacity measures what size battery it uses or the number of cartridges it can hold, and its usage is how much ammunition it uses with each attack. You can use launchers to fire their corresponding missiles, which must be loaded individually. Reloading a weapon or inserting a new battery (including ejecting a spent cartridge or battery if necessary) takes an action (see combat rules for more details).

Weapons that use standard ammunition (arrows, charges, darts, mini-rockets, petrol, rounds, scattergun shells, etc.) are sold preloaded. For weapons with other forms of ammunition (such as grenades), ammunition must be purchased separately.

Weapon descriptions can have a **capacity** which measures the largest-capacity battery it can hold (given in number of charges), the number of rounds of ammunition its magazine can hold, the amount of fuel it carries, or the number of individual cartridges, grenades, or missiles it can hold

A weapon description can have a **usage** which indicates how much ammunition is consumed with each attack you make with the weapon: the number of rounds from a magazine, the number of battery charges from a charged weapon, and so on.

## Critical Effects

Some weapons can have some special effects when scoring a critical hit with them. This effect is done in addition to the additional damage, calculated as normal:

### Arc

The attack’s energy leaps to a second creature. This secondary target must be within 10 feet of your original target and must be the creature closest to the original target (you choose if multiple creatures are equidistant). Roll the amount of damage listed in the weapon’s arc—the secondary target takes this damage (not multiplied by the critical hit), of whatever type the weapon deals.

### Bleed

A bleeding target must make a Constitution saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns. On a failure, the target takes the given amount of necrotic damage. The effect ends when a successful save is made, by gaining hp in any way, or by the target or an adjacent ally spending an action and succeeding in a DC 10 Wis(Medicine) check. The GM may declare some creatures (like undead or constructs) immune to this.

### Burn

The target starts burning. A burning target takes the given fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can spend an action to douse the fire.

### Corrode

This works like Burn, but the damage type is acid

### Deafen

Target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 1 minute.

### Injection

If the weapon is used to deliver a poison or drug of some kind, the target gets disadvantage on the saving throw against it.

### Knockdown

Target is knocked prone

### Severe wound

Roll 1d20 twice on the wound table below and apply the desired effect on the target.

### Staggered

The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw and be affected by the penalties of a Slow spell until the end of your next turn. (have halved speed, a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saves, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can only use an action or bonus action, not both. It also can't make more than one attack during its turn despite items or abilities.)

### Stunned

Target is stunned until the end of your next turn

### Wound

Roll 1d20 on the wound table below and apply the effect on the target

Wound Table

|D20|Effect|
|---|------|
|1-10|Same as the Bleed effect|
|11-13|Eye injury. Target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or gain disadvantage on Wisdom(Perception) checks until treated.|
|14-15|Leg/moving limb injury. Target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or lose 10 ft of speed until treated|
|16-17|Arm/manipulation limb injury. Target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or lose a hand (can not use 2 handed equipment, may gain disadvantage on skill checks that normally use  both hands) until treated.|
|18-19|Vital organ injury. Target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2×minimum proficiency necrotic damage to both its current and max HP, and get disadvantage on Constitution checks and saving throws until the end of its next long rest.|
|20|Head injury. Target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn, and gets disadvantage on Intelligence checks and saving throws until the end of its next long rest.|

Some injuries state “until treated” as its duration. The effect persists until the damaged body part is magically healed (just recovering HP is not enough, a _Regenerate_ effect or similar is needed) or surgically fixed (implanting either a prosthetic, augmentation, or natural body part from a compatible creature). See the “Augmentations” section to check how to get body part replacements surgically.
