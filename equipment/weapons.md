# Weapons

An adventurer’s weapon can be all that stands between them and death. Weapons primarily deal damage, and some have additional special properties. Some weapons also cause specific critical hit effects, which are listed in the weapon tables and described below.

## Minimum Proficiency

As other Star5er equipment, modern weapons have a minimum proficiency requirement. Characters not meeting that proficiency 
requirement are not considered proficient with the weapon.

Some weapons have special effects that call for a saving throw or a skill check. The DC for those rolls is calculated as 
10+minimum proficiency. For example, to reduce damage from a grenade with minimum proficiency of +3, the target must succeed on 
a DC 13 (i.e. 10+3) Dexterity saving throw.

## Ammunition

Weapons often employ electrical charges (typically stored in batteries), cartridges of ammunition, or individual missiles. A weapon’s capacity measures what size battery it uses or the number of cartridges it can hold, and its usage is how much ammunition it uses with each attack. You can use launchers to fire their corresponding missiles, which must be loaded individually. Reloading a weapon or inserting a new battery (including ejecting a spent cartridge or battery if necessary) takes an action (see combat rules for more details).

Weapons that use standard ammunition (arrows, charges, darts, mini-rockets, petrol, rounds, scattergun shells, etc.) are sold preloaded. For weapons with other forms of ammunition (such as grenades), ammunition must be purchased separately.

Weapon descriptions can have a **capacity** which measures the largest-capacity battery it can hold (given in number of charges), the number of rounds of ammunition its magazine can hold, the amount of fuel it carries, or the number of individual cartridges, grenades, or missiles it can hold

A weapon description can have a **usage** which indicates how much ammunition is consumed with each attack you make with the weapon: the number of rounds from a magazine, the number of battery charges from a charged weapon, and so on.

## Critical Effects

Some weapons can have some special effects when scoring a critical hit with them. This effect is done in addition to the additional damage, calculated as normal:

### Arc

The attack’s energy leaps to a second creature. This secondary target must be within 10 feet of your original target and must be the creature closest to the original target (you choose if multiple creatures are equidistant). Roll the amount of damage listed in the weapon’s arc—the secondary target takes this damage (not multiplied by the critical hit), of whatever type the weapon deals.

### Bleed

A bleeding target must make a Constitution saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns. On a failure, the target takes the given amount of necrotic damage. The effect ends when a successful save is made, by gaining hp in any way, or by the target or an adjacent ally spending an action and succeeding in a DC 10 Wis(Medicine) check. The GM may declare some creatures (like undead or constructs) immune to this.

### Burn

The target starts burning. A burning target takes the given fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can spend an action to douse the fire.

### Corrode

This works like Burn, but the damage type is acid

### Deafen

Target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 1 minute.

### Injection

If the weapon is used to deliver a poison or drug of some kind, the target gets disadvantage on the saving throw against it.

### Knockdown

Target is knocked prone

### Severe wound

Roll 1d20 twice on the wound table below and apply the desired effect on the target.

### Staggered

The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw and be affected by the penalties of a Slow spell until the end of your next turn. (have halved speed, a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saves, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can only use an action or bonus action, not both. It also can't make more than one attack during its turn despite items or abilities.)

### Stunned

Target is stunned until the end of your next turn

### Wound

Roll 1d20 on the wound table below and apply the effect on the target

Wound Table

|D20|Effect|
|---|------|
|1-10|Same as the Bleed effect|
|11-13|Eye injury. Target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or gain disadvantage on Wisdom(Perception) checks until treated.|
|14-15|Leg/moving limb injury. Target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or lose 10 ft of speed until treated|
|16-17|Arm/manipulation limb injury. Target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or lose a hand (can not use 2 handed equipment, may gain disadvantage on skill checks that normally use  both hands) until treated.|
|18-19|Vital organ injury. Target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2×minimum proficiency necrotic damage to both its current and max HP, and get disadvantage on Constitution checks and saving throws until the end of its next long rest.|
|20|Head injury. Target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn, and gets disadvantage on Intelligence checks and saving throws until the end of its next long rest.|

Some injuries state “until treated” as its duration. The effect persists until the damaged body part is magically healed (just recovering HP is not enough, a _Regenerate_ effect or similar is needed) or surgically fixed (implanting either a prosthetic, augmentation, or natural body part from a compatible creature). See the “Augmentations” section to check how to get body part replacements surgically.

## Special Properties
The following weapon properties (besides the ones in the PHB) are available for Star5er weapons:

**Analog:** This weapon does not use any advanced electronics, computer systems, or electrical power sources. It is immune to abilities that target technology. While this use of the word “analog” is not technically correct when referring to technology, use of the term in this way has become common throughout the Pact Worlds.

**Archaic:** Characters wearing non archaic armor have resistance to all damage dealt by this weapon. All the weapons and armor in the PHB are considered to have the Archaic property.

**Automatic:** In addition to making ranged attacks normally, a weapon with this special property can fire in fully automatic mode. No action is required to toggle a weapon between making normal ranged attacks and using automatic mode.

When you make a full attack with a weapon in automatic mode, you can attack in a cone with a range of half the weapon’s range. This uses all the weapon’s remaining ammunition. Roll one attack against each target in the cone, starting with those closest to you. Attacks made with a weapon in automatic mode can’t score critical hits. Roll damage only once, and apply it to all targets struck. Each attack against an individual creature in the cone uses up the same amount of ammunition or charges as taking two shots, and once you no longer have enough ammunition to attack another target, you stop making attacks.

For example, if you were using a tactical X-gen gun with 27 rounds remaining, you would target the nearest 6 creatures in the cone and use up all 27 rounds.

If more than one creature is equidistant and you don’t have enough cartridges remaining to shoot at all equidistant creatures, determine randomly which one you target. You can’t avoid shooting at allies in the cone, nor can you shoot any creature more than once, even if you have enough cartridges to fire more shots than you have targets. Attacks in automatic mode take the same penalties as other full attacks.

**Blast:** This weapon fires in a cone that extends only to its single range. You can’t use it to attack creatures beyond that range.

For each attack you make with a weapon with the blast special property, roll one attack against each target in the cone, starting with those closest to you. Each attack is made at disadvantage. Roll damage only once for all targets. If you roll one or more critical hits, roll the extra critical damage only once (or any other special effects on a critical hit that require you to roll) and apply it to each creature against which you score a critical hit. You can’t avoid shooting at allies in the cone, nor can you shoot any creature more than once.

A blast weapon doesn’t benefit from abilities that increase the damage of a single attack (such as sneak attack).

Ammunition for blast weapons is designed for blast attacks, so you spend the usage amount only once for each cone of attacks. 

**Block:** Only melee weapons can have the block special property, which represents some kind of guard or crossbar that can protect you from attacks by a foe you strike in melee. When you successfully strike a target with a melee attack using such a weapon, you gain the benefit of half cover (+2 to AC and Dexterity saving throws) from that target until the beginning of your next turn.

**Boost:** As an action, you can charge up this weapon. The damage for its next attack, as long as it is before the end of your next turn, is boosted by the listed value. Boosting expends charges from the weapon equal to its usage value. This increases the weapon’s damage and is multiplied on a critical hit. Boosting a weapon more than once before firing it doesn’t have any extra effect, and the extra charge dissipates if the weapon is not fired by the end of your next turn.

**Bright:** Attacks with bright weapons illuminate the area within 20 feet of you and your target for 1 round following the attack, increasing the illumination level by one step.

**Disarm:** When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can forgo the damage and try to force it to drop one item of your choice it’s holding. Do not apply the damage, and allow the  target to make a Strength saving throw, the object is dropped on a failure. The DC for this saving throw is 8+the minimum proficiency of the weapon. 

**Entangle:** A creature hit by an entangle weapon becomes restrained until it escapes with a Dex(Acrobatics) or a Str(Athletics) check (DC = 10 + the weapon minimum proficiency). An entangled creature can attempt such a check once at the beginning of each of its turns. Some weapons (such as stickybomb grenades) have a maximum duration for this effect. 

**Explode:** Explosives have the explode special property, which lists the amount of damage the explosion deals, the damage type, special effects (with a duration, if necessary), and the radius of the explosion. When you attack with this type of weapon or ammunition, aim at a grid intersection. Each creature within the blast radius takes the listed damage but can attempt a Dexterity saving throw for half damage. If the explode special property has any special effects other than damage, they are negated with a successful saving throw. Some exploding weapons, such as smoke grenades, don’t deal damage, so they don’t include the damage and damage type entries.

**Injection:** This weapon or its ammunition can be filled with a drug, an injury poison, or a medicinal compound. On a successful attack with the weapon (either the first attack if it’s a melee weapon or an attack with the relevant piece of ammunition if it’s a ranged weapon), the weapon automatically injects the target with the substance.
Refilling the weapon with a new substance acts as reloading it. Each different injectable material must be bought separately and can be used in any weapon with the injection special property.

**Line:** This weapon fires a projectile in a straight line that pierces through multiple creatures or obstacles. When attacking with such a weapon, make a single attack roll and compare it to the relevant AC of all creatures and objects in a line extending to the weapon’s range. Roll damage only once. The weapon hits all targets with an AC equal to or lower than the attack roll. However, if an attack fails to damage a creature or obstacle hit in the line (typically due to damage resistance or immunity), the path is stopped and the attack doesn’t damage creatures farther away. A line weapon can’t damage targets beyond its listed range. If you score a critical hit, that effect applies only to the first target hit in the line, and you roll the critical damage separately. If multiple creatures are equally close, you choose which one takes the effects of the critical hit. A line weapon doesn’t benefit from abilities that increase the damage of a single attack (such as sneak attack).

**Nonlethal:** This weapon only deals non lethal attacks

**Operative:** Consider this as another name for the “Finesse” property as described in the PHB

**Penetrating:** This weapon does double damage to objects

**Powered:** A melee weapon with an internal battery that must be charged to function has the powered special property, which lists its capacity and usage. Unlike with a ranged weapon, the usage is for 1 minute of operation rather than per attack, though using a powered weapon for less than 1 full minute still expends 1 full usage. The number of charges expended is equal to the usage × the number of minutes the weapon is used, rounded up to the nearest minute. You can activate the power of the weapon as part of the action used to make an attack with it, and it automatically deactivates after 1 minute.

As with ranged weapons, you can recharge the battery of a powered melee weapon using a generator or a recharging station, or you can purchase new batteries for it. If you try to attack with a powered weapon that’s out of charges, it functions as an improvised weapon.

**Quick Reload:** You can reload this weapon as part of an action using it, without spending any movement.

**Sniper:** Weapons with the sniper special property can be fired accurately at very long ranges if aimed properly. If you don’t move at all during your turn, you can use the value listed along with this property as the weapon range. You can fire the weapon as normal with its regular range.

**Stun:** You can set a weapon with the stun special property to stun mode (or reset it to normal mode) as a bonus action. While in stun mode, all the weapon’s attacks are nonlethal.

**Trip:** When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can forgo the damage and try to force it to fall. Do not apply the damage, and allow the  target to make a Strength saving throw to avoid getting prone. The DC for this saving throw is 8+the minimum proficiency of the weapon.

**Unwieldy:** Weapons with the unwieldy special property are large and awkward, can’t be fired without cooling down first, or are otherwise difficult to use with repeated attacks. When using the attack action it can fire only once, even if you have an ability that would allow you to make multiple attacks. You can’t attack with it more than once per round, and you can’t use it to make an attack of opportunity.
	
Some weapon tables can add different labels/categories to weapons (for example “longarm” or “cryo weapon”). Those categories don’t have any specific effect by themselves, but other rules that wants to refer to those specific group of weapons may use that labels (for example “you can only equip a longarm in this drone” or “this armor provides resistance to damage from laser weapons”)
