## Converting PHB weapons

Given that only new things were added, 5e weapons should work unchanged. The only change you should apply is adding the “Analog” and “Archaic” properties to medievally built weapons. The GM may choose to not apply the property to similar weapons built with modern methods and materials (like a modern bow working as a non-archaic longbow) and to some magical weapons.

## Converting Starfinder weapons

It should be possible to directly convert starfinder weapons as follows

1. Set the minimum proficiency level based on the SF weapon level (+2 for levels 1-4, +3 for 5-8, +4 for 9-12, +5 for 13-16, and +6 for 17-20).
1. Set the normal range to the range described for SF, and the long range to 3 times that for thrown weapons & grenades and 4 times that for projectile/energy weapons. Area weapons (like line and blast weapons) do not get a long range
1. Leave the name, damage, price, critical effect unchanged. Also use the  capacity and usage unchanged if present.
1. Use the weapon special properties as described here:
     1. Operative weapons should have the finesse property
     1. Items marked as two handed in Starfinder should have the two handed property
     1. You should not use the Heavy, Loading and Versatile properties described in the PHB for converted content
     1. You can add the Light property on one-handed melee weapons that seem physically similar to PHB counterparts and seem practical as dual wielded weapons.
1. Basic Melee and Small Arms are considered Simple Weapons. Everything else is considered Martial
1. Restrict proficiencies on existing classes backgrounds to only apply to archaic weapons.
