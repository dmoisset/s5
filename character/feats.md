# Feats

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.

At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the [Grappler](#grappler) feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow--perhaps by a withering curse--you can't benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.

The D&D handbook contains several feats that you might like but can't be reproduced here for copyright reasons. Feel free to use them in your game if you feel they still mach the Star5er setting. Many of the feats included here are taken form or based on feats from the brilliant [Star Wars 5e](https://sw5e.com/) role playing game (credited with a ˢʷ in their titles)

If you have an ability that enables you to treat deadly wounds more often but with a longer time frame (such as the envoy’s surgeon expertise talent), you cannot use this feat to use that ability more quickly. When used in this way, the _medpatch_ or _sprayflesh_ does not perform any of its normal functions.

Once you’ve targeted a creature with this ability, you can not use it again on the same creature until you take a long rest.

As a reaction, you spend 1 Resolve Point to make an attack roll with a melee weapon of the same general kind (energy or kinetic) and with advantage. If your attack roll is higher than the attack that hit you, the attack is deflected and treated as if it would have missed. This doesn’t work against area attacks.
* If you successfully deflect a projectile, you can spend 1 additional Resolve Point to redirect the attack to a target within 60 feet. Make a ranged attack with disadvantage at a new target. If your attack succeeds, your target receives the damage of the original attack.

## Ranged Defender

If you succeed, your ally can forego half their movement to try to move without provoking an opportunity. Your ally must roll an opposed acrobatic check against the enemy. Your ally gets advantage on this roll. If your ally succeeds the movement doesn’t provoke. If your ally fails the movement provokes normally. This movement is not an action.
* Suppressive Fire: As an action, you can use an automatic weapon you are proficient with to provide covering fire or harrying fire in a cone shaped area with a size of half the weapon normal range. You must spend 10 charges/rounds to use this.

* When you attempt to perform a skill check in starship combat or to repair or maintain your starship, you can add half your proficiency bonus if you’re not proficient with the skill

## Weapon Specialist

Choose a single one of the following benefits that will apply when firing weapons of a specific category. You need to be proficient with the weapon to gain the benefit:

* **Cryo Weapons:** When you hit a creature with a weapon in the cryo category, that creature’s speeds are reduced by 10 feet until the beginning of your next round.
* **Heavy weapons:** When you hit a creature with a modern heavy weapon you can spend 1 Resolve Point to bypass any damage resistance that the target may have to that weapon.
* **Plasma weapons:** If your attack roll with a weapon in the plasma category is a natural 19 (the d20 shows a 19), and the attack hits your target, the target is subject to the Burn critical effect. The effects deals 1d4 fire damage if the weapon minimum proficiency is +2, 1d8 if it’s +3 or +4 and 2d8 if it is higher.
* **Shock Weapons:** When you hit a target with a weapon in the shock category, electricity arcs out from your original target to deal electricity damage to a secondary subject within 10 feet of the original target. This damage is equal to your level. The secondary subject must be the creature nearest to the original target (your choice if multiple creatures are equidistant). This effect does not function for weapons that have the explode or blast special property. If you use this feat with a weapon with the arc critical hit effect, your secondary subject for electric arc must be the same as your secondary subject for the arc critical effect.
* **Sidearms:** When you hit a creature no larger than you using a simple ranged weapon, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or be stunned until the end of its next turn.
* **Sonic weapons:** When you hit a creature within 30 feet of you using a weapon in the sonic category, the sonic energy continues to resonate within that creature, giving it the deafened condition until the beginning of your next  round. If you hit multiple creatures at the same time (such as with an automatic, blast, or explode weapon), only the creature nearest to you or to the center of the explosion (your choice if multiple creatures are equidistant) is affected.

You can select this feat multiple times. Each time choose a different benefit.
