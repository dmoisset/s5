# Races

Star5er is about more than just meeting aliens—it’s also about playing alien characters. In Star5er, the word “race”
usually refers to an intelligent, selfaware species whose members can be considered characters rather than simple
monsters. While not all races are appropriate for player characters, many of them are; any creature with a racial
traits entry is a member of a potentially playable race, provided that your GM approves it.


The following description contains mechanical traits for each race. For general details, and other attributes like age or physical measures check the [Starfinder SRD](https://www.aonsrd.com/Races.aspx?ItemName=All).

## Android

Complex technological creations crafted to resemble humans, androids were originally a servitor race, but they have since
broken free to form their own society. Unlike ordinary robots or ship AIs, androids do not simply respond according to
their programming; rather, they have independent consciousnesses and are animated by souls—a distinction crucial to
their generally accepted status as people rather than property.

Androids have the following traits:

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity Score increases by 2, and your Intelligence by 1

**Size.** Androids are Medium creatures

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 ft.

**Base Hit Points.** You get 4 extra HP at level 1

**Cybernetic organism.** Due to their biological components, androids have to eat and sleep, but they do not need to
breathe or suffer the normal environmental effects of being in a vacuum.

**Darkvision.** Androids have darkvision of 60 ft.

**Constructed.** For effects targeting creatures by type, androids count as both humanoids and constructs (whichever
effect is worse). They receive advantage on saving throws against disease, charm, poison, and sleep, unless those effects
specifically target constructs.

**Flat Affect.** Androids get disadvantage in insight checks against non-androids. Non-androids get disadvantage on
Wisdom (Insight) check against androids.

**Upgrade Slot.** Androids have a single armor upgrade slot in their bodies. Regardless of whether androids are wearing
physical armor, they can use this slot to install any one armor upgrade that could be installed into light armor.


## Human

Ambitious, creative, and endlessly curious, humans have shown more drive to explore their system and the universe beyond
than any of their neighbor races—for better and for worse. They’ve helped usher in a new era of system-wide communication
and organization and are admired for their passion and tenacity, but their tendency to shoot first and think about the
consequences later can make them a liability for those races otherwise inclined to work with them.

You can use the humans (or variants) as in D&D, adding the **Base Hit Points** trait:

**Ability Score Increase.** Your ability scores each increase by 1.

**Size.** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Base Hit Points.** You get 4 extra HP at level 1

## Kasatha

Originally from a planet orbiting a dying star far beyond the Pact Worlds, the four-armed kasathas maintain a reputation
as a noble and mysterious people. They are famous for their anachronistic warriors, ancient wisdom, and strange
traditions.

Kasathas have the following traits:

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom Score increases by 2, and your Strength by 1

**Size.** Kasathas are Medium creatures

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 ft.

**Base Hit Points.** You get 4 extra HP at level 1

**Desert stride.** Kasathas are not affected by difficult terrain in desert, hills and mountains.

**Four armed.** Kasathas have four arms, which allows them to wield and hold up to four hands’ worth of weapons and equipment. While their multiple arms increase the number of items they can have at the ready, it doesn't increase the number of attacks they can make during combat.

**Historian.** Kasathas receive advantage on Intelligence (Culture) checks

**Natural Grace.** You are proficient at either Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) (chosen at
character creation time)

**Languages.** You can speak, read and write Common and Kasatha.

## Lashunta

Idealized by many other humanoid races and gifted with innate psychic abilities, lashuntas are at once consummate
scholars and enlightened warriors, naturally divided into two specialized subraces with different abilities and
societal roles.

Lashuntas have the following traits:

**Ability Score Increase.** Lashuntas gain +2 to Charisma at character creation

**Size.** Lashuntas are Medium creatures

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 ft.

**Limited Telepathy.** Lashuntas can mentally communicate with any creatures within 30 feet with whom they share a language.

**Student.** You gain proficiency in one Intelligence based skill of your choice.

### Damaya Lashunta

## Shirren

Once part of a ravenous hive of locust-like predators, the insectile shirrens only recently broke with their hive mind
to become a race of telepaths physically addicted to their own individualism, yet dedicated to the idea of community and
harmony with other races.

Shirrens have the following traits:

**Ability Score Increase.** Shirrens gain +2 to Constitution and +1 to Wisdom at character creation

**Size.** Shirrens are Medium creatures

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 ft.

**Base Hit Points**: You get 4 extra HP at level 1

**Blindsense.** Shirren’s have 30 feet of blindsense, a weaker form of blindsight. Creatures perceived through this
sense are considered lightly obscured.

**Communalism.** Once, as long as an ally is within 10 feet, a shirren can roll a single attack roll or skill check
at advantage. This ability is recovered after a long rest.

**Cultural Fascination.** Shirrents are proficient in the Culture skill.

**Limited Telepathy.** Shirrens can mentally communicate with any creatures within 30 feet with whom they share a language.

## Vesk

Heavily muscled and covered with thick scales and short, sharp horns, the reptilian vesk are exactly as predatory and
warlike as they appear. Originally hailing from a star system near the Pact Worlds, they sought to conquer and subdue
their stellar neighbors, as they had all the other intelligent races in their own system, until an overwhelming threat
forced them into a grudging alliance with the Pact Worlds—for now.

Vesks have the following traits:

**Ability Score Increase.** Vesks gain +2 to Strength and +1 to Constitution at character creation

**Size.** Vesks are Medium creatures

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 ft.

**Darkvision.** Vesk have darkvision up to 60 ft.

**Natural weapons.** Vesk unarmed strikes are considered modern, not archaic. You can roll a d4 instead of the normal
damage of your unarmed strike.

## Ysoki

Small and furtive, the ysoki are often overlooked by larger races. Yet through wit and technological prowess, they’ve
spread throughout the solar system, giving truth to the old adage that every starship needs a few rats.

Ysoki have the following traits:

**Ability Score Increase.** Ysoki gain +2 to Dexterity and +1 to Intelligence at character creation

**Size.** Ysoki are Small creatures

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 ft.

**Base Hit Points.** You get 2 extra HP at level 1

**Cheek Pouches.** Ysoki can store up to 1 cubic foot of items weighing up to 1 bulk in total in their cheek pouches, and they can transfer a single object between hand and cheek as part of an action using it or as a bonus action. A ysoki can disgorge the entire contents of his pouch onto the ground in his square without spending any action.

**Darkvision.** Ysoki have darkvision of 60 ft.

**Moxie.** A ysoki can stand from prone by sepnding a bonus action and no movement. Ysoki can move through the space of
any creature of a size larger than them.
