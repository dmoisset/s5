## Class Features

As a rogue, you gain the following class features.

### Hit Points

**Hit Points each Level:** 3

**Stamina Points each Level:** 2 + your Constitution modifier (min 0)

### Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor

**Weapons:** Simple weapons, Sniper weapons

**Tools:** Security Kit, Hacking Kit

**Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Intelligence

**Skills:** Choose four skills from Acrobatics, Athletics, Computers, Culture, Deception, Engineering, Insight, Intimidation,
Investigation, Perception, Piloting, Sleight of Hand and Stealth

**Equipment:** You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
* (a) A Knife, survival or (b) Dueling sword, tactical
* (b) A laser pistol, azimuth and a battery with 20 charges or (a)A Knife, survival
* Second Skin armor, Security Kit, Hacking Kit
* An essential kit

### Expertise

At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and one of your tool proficiencies. 
Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with tools) to gain this benefit.

### Sneak Attack

Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 
1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must be a small arm 
or be tagged as "operative" weapon in the weapons list.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't 
incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue 
table.

### Thieves' Cant :five:

During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide 
messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It 
takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area 
is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks 
or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

### Cunning Action :five:

Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on 
each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

### Roguish Archetype :five:

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. The [Operative](#operative) archetipe is described below

### Ability Score Improvement :five:
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Uncanny Dodge :five:

Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the 
attack's damage against you.

### Evasion :five:

Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a grenade explosion or 
an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half 
damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Reliable Talent :five:

By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that 
lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Blindsense :five:

Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

### Slippery Mind :five:

By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

### Elusive :five:

Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has 
advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.

### Stroke of Luck :five:

At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you 
can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Operative

You’re a shadow. You move swiftly, strike suddenly, and always have an escape plan. You’re a consummate professional, and 
you always get the job done, whether it’s scouting enemy lines, hunting down criminals, stealing and smuggling items, or 
assassinating key figures. As an operative, you’re skilled in a wide variety of disciplines and specialties, and use speed, 
mobility, and your quick wits rather than relying on heavy weapons. You excel at the art of surprise, whether it’s sniping 
targets from cover or striking while their backs are turned. Your cause may be righteous, but you have no problem fighting 
dirty—achieving your objective is all that matters.

### Operative Exploits

At 3rd level, you gain one of the special tricks called “operative exploits” listed below. You get 2 additional exploits at 
9th  level, 2 more at 13th level and 2 more at 17th level. You must meet any requirements listed for the exploit to gain it. 
The DC for exploits that require a saving throw is 10+proficiency+Dexterity bonus.

* **Alien Archive:** You can use double your proficiency bonus on checks to know about a creature and its abilities
* **Field treatment:** You can spend a Resolve Point and a minute to gain 3 × your level hit points.
* **Holographic Clone:** As a standard action you can get effects equivalent to a *Mirror Image* spell. Once you use this 
  ability, you can’t use it again until your next long rest.
* **Innoculation:** You are considered proficient in Constitution saves vs disease and poison.
* **Jack of all trades:** You add half your proficiency to skills you’re not proficient with. This works like the Bard
  ability of the same name.
* **Nightvision:** You get Darkvision up to 60 feet
* **Quick Movement:** Your speed increases by 10 feet.
* **Uncanny Pilot:** :warning: vehicle rules
* **Bleeding Shot** (requires level 9): When you score a Sneak Attack, you can inflict a Bleed effect equal to your level. 
  You can only add a single extra effect to your sneak attack.
* **Certainty** (requires level 9): After rolling your specialization skill or one of your expertise skills, as a reaction 
  you can spend a Resolve Point to reroll the skill check and choose which roll to keep.
* **Cloaking Field** (requires level 9): As a bonus action you can activate a cloaking field that makes you lightly obscured 
  (and the effect applies to sound too). This allows you to hide even if you’re being observed and without cover. If you 
  don’t move nor take actions in a round while hidden, you gain a +10 bonus to your previous stealth roll. This field has 10 
  charges and one is spent when activating, or starting your turn with the field active. The charges are restored when you 
  take a long or short rest.
* **Deactivating Shot** (requires level 9): When you score a Sneak Attack, you can suppress a magical or technological item, 
  weapon or armor upgrade worn by the target. Roll 1d20+your proficiency vs 10+the item min proficiency. If you succeed the 
  item loses its magical/technological functions until the beginning of your next turn. The target can spend a bonus action 
  and attempt an Int(Engineering) or Int(Mysticism) check against your operative exploit DC to reactivate the device.

  You can use this to deactivate a construct. If a construct hit by this effect fails a Constitution saving throw, it’s 
  stunned until the beginning of your next turn. A construct is vulnerable to this only once every 24 hours.
* **Debilitating Sniper** (requires level 9): When using a Sniper weapon on a shot that would qualify(except for the weapon 
  type) as a sneak attack, you can apply an extra effect on the sneak attack granted by this class, but you don’t add the 
  sneak attack additional damage.
* **Elusive Hacker** (requires level 9): If you trigger a computer countermeasure by failing a skill check, roll again vs 
  the same DC. If this second check is succesful, the action is still unsuccessful but doesn't trigger the countermeasure.
* **Ever Vigilant** (requires level 9): You still have your passive perception while sleeping, as long as what you’re 
  sensing is not purely visual
* **Glimpse the truth** (requires level 9): As an action you can spend 1 Resolve point to gain truesight until the end of 
  your next turn
* **Hampering Shot** (requires level 9): When you score a Sneak Attack, you can reduce your target speed to half its normal 
  until the beginning of your next turn. You can only add a single extra effect to your sneak attack.
* **Holographic Distraction** (requires level 9): As an action, you create a holographic duplicate of you that moves away
  from you for a minute. It moves as if you were dashing and its movement can include climbing, jumping and avoiding any 
  obstacles. Any creature interacting with the duplicate gets an Intelligence saving throw to recognize it’s not real.
* **Interfering Shot** (requires level 9): When you score a Sneak Attack, you can stop your target from taking reactions 
  until the end of your next turn. You can only add a single extra effect to your sneak attack.
* **Master of Disguise** (requires level 9): As an action you can change your appearance, following the same rules as the 
  *Disguise Self* spell. You can choose to take the appearance of a specific creature you’ve seen. If you’ve heard the 
  creature, you can also imitate its voice and modulation perfectly. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again 
  until your next long rest.
* **Mentalist’s Bane** (level 9): If you fail a Wisdom saving throw against a charm or enchantment effect, you get an 
  additional saving throw at the beginning of your next turn if the effect doesn’t already allow it. If you succeed, the 
  spell or effect is there but its effects on your behaviour are suppressed. If the effects provide a link between you and 
  the originator (for example a Dominate Monster spell) you can keep the link without the control. You can make a Deception 
  check (DC equal to the effect save) to prevent the originator from knowing that you are unaffected. You get at most one of 
  these extra saves per effect.
* **Speed Hacker** (requires level 9): You can disarm/disable mechanical and electronic devices using Engineering/computers 
  at half the usual time.
* **Staggering Shot** (requires level 9): When you score a Sneak Attack, you can stop your target from taking both an 
  action and a bonus action until the beginning of your next turn. The target chooses which (action or bonus) it can take on 
  its turn. You can only add a single extra effect to your sneak attack.
* **Stunning Shot**  (requires level 9): When you score a Sneak Attack, you can stun your target if it fails a Constitution 
  saving throw. After the attempt, the target is immune to this ability until it takes a long rest. You can only add a
  single extra effect to your sneak attack.
* **Uncanny Mobility** (requires level 9): When you use an action to Dash you don’t provoke attacks of opportunity.
* **Uncanny Shooter** (requires level 9): You don’t shoot at disadvantage when firing a small arm within 5 feet of a hostile 
  creature.
* **Versatile Movement** (requires level 9): Climbing or swimming no longer costs you extra movement.
* **Efficient Cloaking Field** (requires level 13 and the Cloaking Field exploit): Your cloaking field has 100 charges (10 
  minutes). As a bonus action, you can spend a Resolve Point to recover 20 used charges even if the field is active.
* **Knockout Shot** (requires level 13 and both the Staggering Shot and Stunning Shot exploits): When you score a Sneak 
  Attack, you can knock your target unconscious if it fails a Constitution saving throw. After the attempt, the target is 
  immune to this ability until it takes a long rest. You can only add a single extra effect to your sneak attack.
* **Multiattack Mastery** (requires level 13): If when using the Extra Attack you land at least 2 hits on your target 
  without using Sneak Attack, you can apply one of the exploit effects that are allowed in a Sneak Attack to the last hit.
* **Uncanny Senses** (requires level 13 and darkvision 60): You get blindsight up to 30 feet, and your darkvision range 
  increases by 30 feet.

Note that some of these effects duplicate spells but are not considered magical unless stated otherwise, and as such can 
not be counterspelled or dispelled, and work within an *Antimagic field*.

### Specialization

At 3th level you choose a specialization from the list below. For each specialization there’s an associated skill; you gain 
proficiency to that skill. Operatives have to choose their specialization skill as one of their rogue expertise skills at 
6th level. Also, you can make as bonus action a DC 15 check on that skill in combat; if you succeed, the next attack you 
make in the same turn gains the benefit of Sneak Attack if it hits. Each specialization also gives you access to an 
additional operative exploit, even if you don’t meet the prerequisites for it.

* **Daredevil:** Acrobatics (you move quickly to land a sneak attack); Versatile movement exploit
* **Detective:** Insight (you read your opponent to land a sneak attack); Glimpse the truth exploit
* **Explorer:** Survival (you use your surroundings to position yourself for a sneak attack); Ever vigilant exploit
* **Ghost:** Stealth(you move without being noticed to land a sneak attack); Cloaking Field exploit
* **Hacker:** Computers(you create a distraction with surrounding equipment to land a sneak attack. This may not work in 
  non-civilized locations); Elusive hacker exploit
* **Spy:** Deception(You feint your opponent to land a sneak attack); Master of Disguise exploit
* **Thief:** Sleight of Hands(you conceal your weapons and motions to land a sneak attack); Holographic distraction exploit

### Extra attack

At 9th Level you can attack twice instead of once, when you take the attack action in your turn.
