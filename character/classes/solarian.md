# Solarian

The stars guide the planets with gravity, create life with light and heat, and utterly consume worlds in supernovas and black holes. You understand that these acts of creation and destruction are not opposites, but rather two parts of a natural, dualistic cycle. You seek to be an agent of that cycle, an enlightened warrior with the ability to manipulate the forces of the stars themselves. Constantly accompanied by a mote of fundamental energy or entropy, you can shape this essence in combat to create weapons and armor of gleaming stellar light or pure, devouring darkness. Whether you apprenticed in a temple or came to your powers through personal revelation, you recognize yourself as part of an ancient tradition—a force of preservation and annihilation.

### Skill Adept

As part of the process that led you to become a solarian, you gained additional insight and training. Choose an additional skill to be proficient with.

### Solar Manifestation

At 1st level, you gain a physical manifestation of your stellar power. The base form of your solar manifestation, when not actively in use, is a mote of stellar energy slightly smaller than your fist that hovers near your head. Beyond the solar mote, your manifestation can take one of two additional forms: armor or a weapon. You must pick one [solar manifestation](#solar-manifestations) (either armor or a weapon) upon taking your first level of solarian. You also choose whether your solar manifestation (in any form) either glows brightly with one color common to stars (including blue, red, white, or yellow) or is the perfect darkness of a black hole. A glowing solar manifestation, regardless of its form, sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. You can shut off the light or darkness as an  action in order to blend in or assist in stealth, but whenever you enter a stellar mode (see below), the glow or darkness returns immediately. Once made, these choices cannot be changed.

Your [solar manifestation](#solar-manifestations) grants you some abilities at 1st, 5th, 10th, 15th and 20th level.

Only you can interact with your solar manifestation, whether in mote, armor, or weapon form. No other creature or effect can affect your solar manifestation in any way, including disarming or sundering it.

### Stellar Mode

The stellar forces you call on are attuned to either photons (representing the power of stars to emit heat, light, and plasma) or gravitons (representing the power of stars to attract and imprison objects through gravity). The ultimate expression of photon power is the supernova, when all of a star’s energy is exerted outward, while the ultimate expression of graviton power is the black hole, where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The balance between these two opposing cosmic forces is the source of your power, and your stellar mode represents the strength of your connection with one or both of these forces—a relationship that shifts from one moment to the next as you use your stellar revelations.

You can enter a stellar mode only in combat, while facing a high-stake situation; the DM can rule some non-combat situations as appropriate, or combat against non-significant foes as inadequate for this purpose. Your stellar mode will be useful to make some of your solarian abilities (called “Revelations”) more powerful.

At the beginning of a combat turn you can either get a single attunement point, or lose your attunement points. Each attunement point is either a photon point or a graviton point. You can choose any, but you can not hold different kind of points at the same time. Furthermore, you can have at most 3 attunement points. Your stellar mode is said to be “photon attuned” if you have photon attunement points, or “graviton attuned” if you have “graviton attunement points”. Finally, you’re said to be “fully attuned” if you hold 3 attunement points.

If the combat ends or you fall unconscious, you become unattuned (i.e. lose all your attunement points). Gaining or losing attunement points does not involve actions.

### Zenith Revelations

You can learn secrets about the powers of energy, gravity, stars, and other fundamental sources of cosmic power that grant you the ability to channel these forces and manifest potent preternatural powers (usually called “[revelations](#stellar-revelations-1)”). The most powerful of these, called “[Zenith revelations](#zenith-revelations-1)” require your [stellar mode](#stellar-mode) to be fully attuned to either photon or graviton energy to use them. Each zenith revelation indicates which kind of attunement it requires. After using a Zenith revelation, you immediately become unattuned (i.e. lose all your attunement points)

At 1st level you gain the “[Black Hole(graviton)](#black-hole-eightpointedblackstar)” and “[Supernova(Photon)](#supernova-eightspokedasterisk)” zenith revelations. At 9th level and again at 17th level, you choose 2 revelations from the list of Zenith Revelations. You must choose a photon and a graviton zenith revelation each time.

### Stellar Revelations

When reaching every even level you gain a stellar revelation. You must choose from the [list of Stellar Revelations](#stellar-revelations-1) below and only one that’s allowed for your level. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can not unbalance your number of photon vs graviton revelations, so if you know more revelations of one kind, you must choose one from the opposite kind.

Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. You use your Charisma modifier and your proficiency bonus for the DC of saves for a Revelation or attack rolls made with one: 

**Revelation Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier    
**Revelation Attack Modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can’t enter a [stellar mode](#stellar-mode) outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for “1 round or as long as you’re in a stellar mode” lasts only 1 round if you’re not in combat.

### Sidereal Influence

You can tap into stellar forces outside of battle, using the properties of gravitons or photons to affect your skill use. At 3rd level, choose two skills from the lists below, one from the graviton list and one from the photon list. At 11th level choose two more skills. Each time you pick skills, choose one from the graviton list and one from the photon list.

To use your sidereal influence, you must spend 1 minute in meditation, then choose either graviton skills or photon skills. When attempting a skill check with one of your selected skills of the chosen type (either graviton or photon), you can roll 1d6 and add the result to your check. This ability lasts until you enter combat, fall unconscious, sleep, or meditate again to choose a different skill type. You can reactivate this ability by meditating again for 1 minute.

- **Graviton Skills:** Athletics(Str), Deception (Cha), Insight(Wis), Mysticism (Wis), Stealth (Dex)
- **Photon Skills:** Culture (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Medicine (Int), Persuasion (Cha), Survival (Wis)

### Ability Score improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Flashing Strikes

Once you reach 7th level, after taking an Attack action with only melee weapons, you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 13th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn using melee weapons.

### Stellar Paragon

When you reach 20th level, you are the spiritual kin of the stars themselves. As a bonus action, you can raise or lower light levels within 30 feet of yourself by one step. You can gain 2 attunement points (of the same type) at the beginning of your turn, allowing you to become fully attuned after 2 rounds.
In addition, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to gain enough attunement points to be fully attuned on the first round of combat (but not after using a [zenith revelation](#zenith-revelations)), or spend 1 Resolve Point at the start of your turn in combat to exchange all of your attunement points in one [stellar mode](#stellar-mode) for an equal number of attunement points in the other mode. For example, you can switch from being fully attuned in graviton mode to being fully attuned in photon mode.

## Stellar Revelation Descriptions

You learn your first stellar revelation at 2nd level, and learn an additional revelation every 2 levels thereafter. Stellar revelations require you to have a minimum level, and are organized accordingly. Additionally, each is marked with a symbol that indicates whether it is a :eight_pointed_black_star: graviton revelation or a :eight_spoked_asterisk: photon revelation.

### Dark Matter :eight_pointed_black_star:

As a bonus action, you can draw on the properties of dark matter to increase your density, allowing you to resist physical damage. You gain resistance to either piercing, slashing or bludgeoning damage. If you’re unattuned, the benefit lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

If attuned in graviton mode, you can extend the duration of this benefit using your concentration (if you fail a concentration check, or your attunement ends, the benefit is immediately lost).

When you are fully attuned to graviton mode, this gives you resistance to piercing, bludgeoning and slashing damage.

### Flare :eight_spoked_asterisk:

As a bonus action, you can shed light in a 30-foot radius for 1 minute. You choose dim, normal, or bright light each time you activate this revelation. As an action, you can create a flash of brilliant light, forcing one creature within 30 feet to succeed at a Dexterity save or be blinded until the end of its next turn. Once you’ve targeted a creature with flare, you can’t target it with this revelation again for 10 minutes. Blind or sightless creatures are not affected by this use of this revelation.

When you create a flash of light as an action and you are attuned or fully attuned to photon mode, you can instead choose to give all enemies within range disadvantage on perception checks (no save) until the end of their next turns.

### Gravity Anchor :eight_pointed_black_star:

As a bonus action, you can form a gravitational bond between yourself and either the surface you’re standing on or the objects you are holding. This grants you advantage on any saves to prevent you from being involuntarily moved, and disadvantage on special attacks that move you if you choose the surface underfoot. It grants advantage on checks to hold onto items if you choose objects. If you’re not in graviton mode, the bonus lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

When you are attuned or fully attuned to graviton mode, you can use your concentration to extend the effect until you leave graviton mode.

When you are attuned or fully attuned to graviton mode, you can activate this revelation as a reaction when targeted by an attack/effect that could be protected by this ability, in which case it defends against only that attack.

### Gravity Boost :eight_pointed_black_star:

You can increase or reduce the gravitational attraction between yourself and the terrain around you. You can add your proficiency bonus (if not proficient) to Strength (Athletics) checks to climb, jump, or swim as part of the action you take to attempt the skill check. In addition, as a reaction when you are falling, you can reduce the falling damage you take by half.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can move along vertical surfaces and even upside down along ceilings during your turn. This functions as [_spider climb_](../../magic/spells/spider_climb.md), but it leaves your hands free and you can also run. You must end your movement on a surface that can support you normally. If you end your movement while you are standing on a vertical surface or ceiling, you fall unless you succeed at an Athletics check to climb to remain in position.

### Gravity Hold :eight_pointed_black_star:

This revelation allows you to move objects at a distance as per [_psychokinetic hand_](../../magic/spells/mage_hand.html).
When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can use the _psychokinetic hand_ ability of your gravity hold to immobilize, lift, or move a Medium or smaller creature. The creature can attempt a Strength saving throw to negate the effect. While under this effect, the target is grappled. This ability follows all of the restrictions of the spell other than the weight limit, but you can’t lift a creature higher than 5 feet off the ground. You can spend an action in each turn to maintain the gravity hold, and the target can attempt a new save to end the effect. Once a creature successfully saves against this ability, it becomes immune to further uses of this revelation for 24 hours.

### Plasma Sheath :eight_spoked_asterisk:

As a bonus action, you can cause all of your melee attacks to deal fire damage instead of their normal damage type. This benefit lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode.
When you are attuned or fully attuned, your attacks with plasma sheath deal additional fire damage equal to half your level.

### Radiation :eight_spoked_asterisk:

As an action, you can emit an aura of low-level radiation. Creatures within 5 feet of you must succeed at a Constitution save or be poisoned. A creature poisoned this way recovers as soon as it moves out of your aura, and a creature that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to your radiation for 24 hours. This is a poison effect. The radiation lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, the size of your aura increases to 10 feet.

### Stellar Rush :eight_spoked_asterisk:

You gain the Charger feat

When you are attuned or fully attuned, and charging to shove (with at least 10 feet in straight line at the end of the dash) you can burst in flames while doing so. Whether or not you succeed at the bull rush, the target takes 2d6 fire damage (Dexterity save for half). This damage increases by 1d6 at 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter.

## Stellar Revelations (level 6)

The following revelations can only be chosen when you’re at least 6th level

### Astrologic Sense :eight_spoked_asterisk:

You can sense the movement of all objects influencing you to gain insight into upcoming events. Once per day as an action, you can try to determine whether a particular action of yours will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future. This functions as [augury](../../magic/spells/augury.md). You can spend 1 Resolve Point to use this revelation again on the same day, but you still can’t use it more than once per hour.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can see 1 hour into the future (instead of half an hour as is normal for _augury_) when you use this revelation.

### Blazing Orbit:eight_spoked_asterisk:

As a bonus action, you gain resistance against damage from opportunity attacks, and any attack against you during your turn gets disadvantage. You can leave a trail of flames in every square you pass through after enabling this ability. The flames last until the beginning of your next round and deal 2d6 fire damage to anyone who moves into them. You can’t move through another creature’s space while doing this. If you use blazing orbit again, any flames you previously created with it go out. The damage from the flames increases by 1d6 at 8th level and every 2 levels thereafter.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, any creature damaged by the flames also gains the burning condition (1d6 fire damage).

### Corona:eight_spoked_asterisk:

As an action, you can surround your body with an envelope of fiery plasma. You gain cold resistance, and any adjacent creature that hits you with a natural weapon or a melee weapon takes 2d6 fire damage. The corona lasts until the beginning of your next turn. The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 11th level (3d6) and 17th level (4d6).

When you are attuned or fully attuned, any creature that starts its turn adjacent to you while your corona is in effect takes 2d6 fire damage.

### Crush:eight_pointed_black_star:

As an action, you can increase the effects of gravity on the internal organs or workings of a target within 30 feet, causing it to have difficulty maintaining its normal functionality. The target must succeed at a Constitution save or become staggered until the beginning of your next turn. This revelation also affects constructs. You can maintain this effect as a bonus action each round, but the target is allowed a new saving throw during your attempt to end the effect. Once a creature succeeds at this save or the effect ends, you can’t target that creature with crush again for 24 hours.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to also stun the target for 1 round. Maintaining crush on subsequent rounds extends the staggered effect, but not the stunned effect.

### Defy Gravity :eight_pointed_black_star:

As a bonus action, you gain the ability to fly using your remaining movement. You lose this flight ability by the end of your turn, falling if you don't have other means of support.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you gain an additional 30 feet of movement for this turn.

### Glow of Life :eight_spoked_asterisk:

As a bonus action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to recover a number of Hit Points equal to your solarian level. Once you use this revelation, you can’t use it again until your next short rest.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, increase the amount you heal with this revelation to two times your solarian level.

### Gravity Surge :eight_pointed_black_star:

As an action, you can perform a disarm or trip attempt against a target within 30 feet. Make an attack with your Revelation Attack bonus, if successful your target drops an object they are holding or is dropped prone (your choice).

When you are attuned or fully attuned, if you disarm a target with gravity surge and have a hand free, the dropped item flies toward you and you can snatch it from the air. If you trip a target with gravity surge, you can pull the target up to 10 feet closer to you.

### Hypnotic Glow :eight_spoked_asterisk:

As an action, you can convince one living creature that you are to be trusted. This functions as [_charm person_](../../magic/spells/charm_person.md), but with a duration of 1 minute. When the effect ends, if you are out of line of sight and the target is not engaged in an activity it wouldn’t have begun without being charmed, the target does not realize it was charmed or has acted unusually unless someone else points it out. You can’t use this revelation again while you currently have a creature charmed via this ability, and once you’ve attempted to charm a creature, whether or not the attempt was successful, you can’t charm the same creature again for 24 hours. Your influence over the creature ends once the duration has expired, and at that time the target likely ceases doing anything you’ve requested of it. At 9th level, hypnotic glow can be used also against non-humanoids.

When you are attuned or fully attuned and you successfully charm a creature using this ability, you can also command it to approach, flee, or halt on its next turn, as per the [_command_](../../magic/spells/command.md) spell (with no additional save).

### Reflection :eight_pointed_black_star:

You can reflect ranged attacks back at your enemies. If you took the dodge action on your last turn, or by spending 1 Resolve Point, as a reaction you can redirect a ranged attack that misses you. Select a new target within 30 feet and make a ranged attack roll with disadvantage. If your attack hits, the new target is damaged as if it had been the intended target of the original ranged attack.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you don’t take disadvantage to your redirected attack roll.

## Stellar Revelations (level 10)

The following revelations can only be chosen when you’re at least 10th level

### Soul Furnace :eight_spoked_asterisk:

You can stoke the internal energy of your entire physiology, allowing you to boost your life processes. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point. If you are suffering from an affliction (a curse, disease, drug or poison), you can immediately attempt an additional saving throw at the affliction’s normal save DC. If you succeed at this saving throw, the affliction ends (regardless of how many successful saving throws it normally takes to end the affliction). Once you have used this revelation, you can’t use it again until your next short rest.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can also use this revelation to end any one of the following conditions/effects you have: bleeding, blinded, burning, frightened, or poisoned. Alternatively you can use it to remove 1 level of exhaustion.

### Stealth Warp :eight_pointed_black_star:

You can bend light, sound, and even vibrations around your body, making you harder to notice. As a bonus action, you can grant you advantage to Dexterity(Stealth) checks. This lasts until the beginning of your next turn or until you leave graviton mode.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can use this revelation to reduce your sensory output so much that you can attempt to Hide even if observed. You are not invisible, simply difficult to see clearly, and if a creature was observing you prior to your Hide attempt, it remains aware of your location until you successfully reach cover or concealment. Your stealth warp ends if you make an attack or cast a spell, or at the beginning of your next turn unless you immediately take another bonus action to use this revelation.

## Stellar Revelations (level 14)

The following revelations can only be chosen when you’re at least 14th level

### Gravity Shield :eight_pointed_black_star:

As a bonus action, you can create a minor shield of compressed gravity waves, granting you a +1 bonus to your AC. The shield lasts until the beginning of your next turn or until you leave graviton mode.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, as a bonus action, you can create a disk of massive gravitational energies that is capable of deflecting incoming attacks. The shield extends over one edge of your space (you choose which one). The shield provides three-quarters cover against attacks coming from its far side, but not against attacks originating from the side you’re on. If you move, you can reposition your shield as part of your movement, moving it to a different edge of your space. You must use one of your hands to direct and maintain an active gravity shield. You cannot use this version of the gravity shield at the same time you use this revelation to gain a bonus to your AC. This gravity shield also lasts until the beginning of your next turn or until you leave graviton mode.

### Sunbolt :eight_spoked_asterisk:

As an action, you can fire a bolt of concentrated solar energy at one target within 120 ft as a ranged revelation attack. If you hit, you deal 9d6 fire damage. If you have a solarian crystal that changes the type of damage dealt by a solar weapon, you can use it to change the type of damage you deal with your sunbolt. Once you have used this revelation, you can’t use it again until you take a short rest.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you gain advantage to your attack roll to use this revelation.

## Stellar Revelations (level 16)

The following revelations can only be chosen when you’re at least 16th level

### Ultimate Graviton :eight_pointed_black_star:

As your ability to manipulate powers of gravity expands, the range of any graviton revelation (but not zenith revelation) you have with a range doubles. Any graviton revelation (but not zenith revelation) you have that targets a single creature can now simultaneously target two creatures, who must be within 20 feet of each other. You also increase the power of any of the following gravity revelations you have.

- Defy Gravity: You get an additional 15 feet of movement when using this revelation
- Gravity Anchor: When using this revelation, you can gain both types of gravity anchor simultaneously.
- Gravity Boost: Your bonus applies to all Strength checks, and you take no damage from any fall.
- Reflection: If you successfully redirect an attack you recover your reaction, but this reaction can only be used for this ability. This can be repeated multiple times. If any reflected attack misses, your reaction is spent and you can’t make further redirect attempts until you use this revelation again.

### Ultimate Photon :eight_spoked_asterisk:

Your ability to manipulate powers of light and energy expand greatly. The radius of any photon revelation (but not zenith revelation) you have with a radius expands by 10 feet. Any photon revelation (but not zenith revelation) that lasts until the beginning of your next turn or until you leave photon mode can be extended by rolling 3 or more in 1d6 when starting your turn. You also increase the power of any of the following photon revelations you have.

- Astrologic Sense: You can see twice as far into the future as normal.
- Glow of Life: You can use this revelation as a free action, rather than a bonus action.
- Hypnotic Glow: The charm’s duration doubles.
- Stellar Rush: You gain a +2 bonus to your AC until the beginning of your next turn.

## Zenith Revelation Descriptions

The following is the full list of Zenith Revelations. All of them require full attunement, and spend the attunement when used.

### Black Hole :eight_pointed_black_star:

When you’re fully graviton-attuned, as an action, you can pull any number of creatures within 20 feet of you closer. You choose which creatures are affected and which ones aren’t. Each target must succeed at a Strength saving throw or be pulled 10 feet toward you. The range of this revelation and the distance pulled increase by 5 feet at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Solid objects do not block this ability, but any creature that runs into a solid object ceases moving closer to you.

### Miniature Star :eight_spoked_asterisk:

When you're fully photon attuned, you can create a simulacrum of a star as an action. The star is a 15-foot diameter sphere that fills your square (or one of your squares if you're larger) and every square around it. Any creature starting its turns within the start takes 1d6 fire damage for every 2 solarian levels you have, and any creature that starts its turn outside the start but within 5 feet takes half that damage. At 17th level, you can create your star simulacrum as a 25-foot radius sphere affecting your square and every square within 10 feets of that.

Creatures can move through the star but it exerts a gravitational pull, and they must spend double movement to move away from the center while they are within the star or within 5 feet of its edge. The star remains in place if you later move for 3 rounds. You are immune to all effects of your own miniature star

### Ray of Light :eight_spoked_asterisk:

When you're fully photon attuned, as a bonus action you can transform yourself into a ray of light ad move at light speed to any spece you can see within 500ft. Any barrier that would block, reflext or scatter light prevents you from moving through it. No creature can use a reaction to interfere with your movement or make attacks of opportunity unless it's capable of reacting faster than the speed of light. At 17th level, you can touch one willing or unconscious creature to convert it to light and bring it with you as part of the same action.

### Solar Acceleration :eight_spoked_asterisk:

While you're fully photon-attuned, you can make two attacks as an action. In addition, you and up to 6 allies within 30 feet are affected by [_haste_](../../magic/spells/haste.md). You are considered to be concentrating in this spell. At 17th level, the extra speed from the haste effect increases by 30 ft.

### Starquake :eight_pointed_black_star:

When you're fully graviton attuned, you can create a violent ripple of movement to knock down your foes. As a bonus action, you can move on ground during your turn without provoking attacks of opportunity. Each creature you are adjacent to at any point during that movement takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. The affected creatures don't need to be standing in solid ground to fall prone, and any that were in the air (but still adjacent to you) fall to the ground on a failed save. The damage increases to 2d8 at level 10, 3d8 at level 13, and 5d8 at level 17. At 17th level, you can also move up to twice your speed along the ground when using this revelation.

### Supernova :eight_spoked_asterisk:

When you’re fully photon-attuned, as an action, you can deal 1d6 fire damage plus 1d6 additional fire damage per solarian level to all creatures within 10 feet of you. A creature that succeeds at a Dexterity saving throw takes half damage. At 9th level, you can increase the radius to 15 feet, and at 17th level, you can increase the radius to 20 feet.

### Time Dilation :eight_pointed_black_star:

When you’re fully graviton-attuned, you can make time pass more slowly for your enemies. As an action, you can project a gravitational wave in a 30-foot cone. You choose which creatures in the cone are affected and which ones aren't. Each target must succeed at a Charisma saving throw or by affected by [_slow_](../../magic/spells/slow.md). The duration of this effect is as per the spell (and it requires you to hold concentration). At 17th level, even targets that succeed at their saving throws are affected by slow until the beginning of your next turn.

### Wormholes :eight_pointed_black_star:

When you’re fully graviton-attuned, you can create two linked wormholes as an action. One wormhole must be adjacent to you, and the other appears anywhere in line of sight within 200 ft. Each wormhole is 5 feet across and appears at an intersection between two squares. You and any Large or smaller creatures you mentally designate (you can designate “all creatures,” “all lashuntas,” or similar categories) can travel between the wormholes. This is considered extradimensional travel. Entering a wormhole instantly transports a creature to a square adjacent to the other wormhole’s intersection, where the creature can continue its movement. The wormholes remain for 1 minute, but you can choose to termine the effect earlier as a free action. At 17th level, you can create three wormholes using this ability, and upon entering the wormhole, a creature can decide which of the other two wormholes to exit.


## Solar Manifestations

### Solar Armor

You can form your solar mote into a suit of armor made out of stellar energy that outlines your body. This armor appears to be made out of glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can take whatever general shape you choose, whether glowing armored plates of solidified stellar energy, a form-fitting suit of crackling energy, or an aura of stellar plasma. Your solar armor’s general design has no impact on its function and doesn’t give the armor any special abilities. Once you’ve selected the general design, you can’t change it until you gain a new solarian level.

Your solar armor grants you a +1 bonus to your AC. This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level. It is compatible with [light armor](../../equipment/armor.md#light-armor) and [medium armor](../../equipment/armor.md#medium-armor), but it gives you no benefit if you’re wearing heavy armor. At 5th level, you also gain energy resistance while your solar armor is active. You can choose either cold resistance or fire resistance when you activate the armor, and you can switch energy types as a bonus action. At 15th level it provides you resistance against both kinds of damage. At 20th level you can, as a bonus action, make it immune to either cold or fire.

Forming or dismissing solar armor is a free action.

### Solar Weapon

You can seize your solar mote in one hand to form a melee weapon out of stellar energy. This weapon appears to be made out of glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can be whatever general shape you choose. Normal melee weapons like axes, swords, and spears are most common, but other shapes, such as a large rune of stellar energy, a mass of writhing energy tendrils, or an energized fist that fits over your own hand, are possible as well. Your solar weapon’s general design has no impact on its function, and doesn’t give the weapon any special abilities such as reach.

Your solar weapon functions as a one-handed martial melee weapon, and you’re automatically proficient with it. At 1st level, choose whether your solar weapon deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can change the damage type each time you gain a new solarian level. Your solar weapon deals damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. This damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 10th level, 8d6 at 15th level and 12d6 at 20th level. Solarian weapon crystals can increase your solar weapon’s damage.

Forming or dismissing a solar weapon takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (so can for example be made for free as part of your attack action). Your solar weapon is automatically dismissed if it ever leaves your hand.
