# Solarian

The stars guide the planets with gravity, create life with light and heat, and utterly consume worlds in supernovas and black holes. You understand that these acts of creation and destruction are not opposites, but rather two parts of a natural, dualistic cycle. You seek to be an agent of that cycle, an enlightened warrior with the ability to manipulate the forces of the stars themselves. Constantly accompanied by a mote of fundamental energy or entropy, you can shape this essence in combat to create weapons and armor of gleaming stellar light or pure, devouring darkness. Whether you apprenticed in a temple or came to your powers through personal revelation, you recognize yourself as part of an ancient tradition—a force of preservation and annihilation.

### Skill Adept

As part of the process that led you to become a solarian, you gained additional insight and training. Choose an additional skill to be proficient with.

### Solar Manifestation
At 1st level, you gain a physical manifestation of your stellar power. The base form of your solar manifestation, when not actively in use, is a mote of stellar energy slightly smaller than your fist that hovers near your head. Beyond the solar mote, your manifestation can take one of two additional forms: armor or a weapon. You must pick one [solar manifestation](#solar-manifestations) (either armor or a weapon) upon taking your first level of solarian. You also choose whether your solar manifestation (in any form) either glows brightly with one color common to stars (including blue, red, white, or yellow) or is the perfect darkness of a black hole. A glowing solar manifestation, regardless of its form, sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. You can shut off the light or darkness as a standard action in order to blend in or assist in stealth, but whenever you enter a stellar mode (see below), the glow or darkness returns immediately. Once made, these choices cannot be changed.

Your [solar manifestation](#solar-manifestations) grants you some abilities at 1st, 5th, 10th, 15th and 20th level.

Only you can interact with your solar manifestation, whether in mote, armor, or weapon form. No other creature or effect can affect your solar manifestation in any way, including disarming or sundering it.

### Stellar Mode

The stellar forces you call on are attuned to either photons (representing the power of stars to emit heat, light, and plasma) or gravitons (representing the power of stars to attract and imprison objects through gravity). The ultimate expression of photon power is the supernova, when all of a star’s energy is exerted outward, while the ultimate expression of graviton power is the black hole, where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The balance between these two opposing cosmic forces is the source of your power, and your stellar mode represents the strength of your connection with one or both of these forces—a relationship that shifts from one moment to the next as you use your stellar revelations.

You can enter a stellar mode only in combat, while facing a high-stake situation; the DM can rule some non-combat situations as appropriate, or combat against non-significant foes as inadequate for this purpose. Your stellar mode will be useful to make some of your solarian abilities (called “Revelations”) more powerful.

At the beginning of a combat turn you can either get a single attunement point, or lose your attunement points. Each attunement point is either a photon point or a graviton point. You can choose any, but you can not hold different kind of points at the same time. Furthermore, you can have at most 3 attunement points. Your stellar mode is said to be “photon attuned” if you have photon attunement points, or “graviton attuned” if you have “graviton attunement points”. Finally, you’re said to be “fully attuned” if you hold 3 attunement points.

If the combat ends or you fall unconscious, you become unattuned (i.e. lose all your attunement points). Gaining or losing attunement points does not involve actions.

### Zenith Revelations

You can learn secrets about the powers of energy, gravity, stars, and other fundamental sources of cosmic power that grant you the ability to channel these forces and manifest potent preternatural powers (usually called “[revelations](#stellar-revelations-1)”). The most powerful of these, called “[Zenith revelations](#zenith-revelations-1)” require your [stellar mode](#stellar-mode) to be fully attuned to either photon or graviton energy to use them. Each zenith revelation indicates which kind of attunement it requires. After using a Zenith revelation, you immediately become unattuned (i.e. lose all your attunement points)

At 1st level you gain the “[Black Hole(graviton)](#black-hole-eightpointedblackstar)” and “[Supernova(Photon)](#supernova-eightspokedasterisk)” zenith revelations. At 9th level and again at 17th level, you choose 2 revelations from the list of Zenith Revelations. You must choose a photon and a graviton zenith revelation each time.

### Stellar Revelations

When reaching every even level you gain a stellar revelation. You must choose from the [list of Stellar Revelations](#stellar-revelations=1) below and only one that’s allowed for your level. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can not unbalance your number of photon vs graviton revelations, so if you know more revelations of one kind, you must choose one from the opposite kind.

Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. You use your Charisma modifier and your proficiency bonus for the DC of saves for a Revelation or attack rolls made with one: 

**Revelation Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier    
**Revelation Attack Modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can’t enter a [stellar mode](#stellar-mode) outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for “1 round or as long as you’re in a stellar mode” lasts only 1 round if you’re not in combat.

### Sidereal Influence

You can tap into stellar forces outside of battle, using the properties of gravitons or photons to affect your skill use. At 3rd level, choose two skills from the lists below, one from the graviton list and one from the photon list. At 11th level choose two more skills. Each time you pick skills, choose one from the graviton list and one from the photon list.

To use your sidereal influence, you must spend 1 minute in meditation, then choose either graviton skills or photon skills. When attempting a skill check with one of your selected skills of the chosen type (either graviton or photon), you can roll 1d6 and add the result to your check. This ability lasts until you enter combat, fall unconscious, sleep, or meditate again to choose a different skill type. You can reactivate this ability by meditating again for 1 minute.

- **Graviton Skills:** Athletics(Str), Deception (Cha), Insight(Wis), Mysticism (Wis), Stealth (Dex)
- **Photon Skills:** Culture (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Medicine (Int), Persuasion (Cha), Survival (Wis)

### Ability Score improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Flashing Strikes

Once you reach 7th level, after taking an Attack action with only melee weapons, you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 13th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn using melee weapons.

### Stellar Paragon

When you reach 20th level, you are the spiritual kin of the stars themselves. As a bonus action, you can raise or lower light levels within 30 feet of yourself by one step. You can gain 2 attunement points (of the same type) at the beginning of your turn, allowing you to become fully attuned after 2 rounds.
In addition, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to gain enough attunement points to be fully attuned on the first round of combat (but not after using a [zenith revelation](#zenith-revelations)), or spend 1 Resolve Point at the start of your turn in combat to exchange all of your attunement points in one [stellar mode](#stellar-mode) for an equal number of attunement points in the other mode. For example, you can switch from being fully attuned in graviton mode to being fully attuned in photon mode.

## Stellar Revelations

You learn your first stellar revelation at 2nd level, and learn an additional revelation every 2 levels thereafter. Stellar revelations require you to have a minimum level, and are organized accordingly. Additionally, each is marked with a symbol that indicates whether it is a :eight_pointed_black_star: graviton revelation or a :eight_spoked_asterisk: photon revelation.

### Dark Matter :eight_pointed_black_star:

As a bonus action, you can draw on the properties of dark matter to increase your density, allowing you to resist physical damage. You gain resistance to either piercing, slashing or bludgeoning damage. If you’re unattuned, the benefit lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

If attuned in graviton mode, you can extend the duration of this benefit using your concentration (if you fail a concentration check, or your attunement ends, the benefit is immediately lost).

When you are fully attuned to graviton mode, this gives you resistance to piercing, bludgeoning and slashing damage.

### Flare :eight_spoked_asterisk:

As a bonus action, you can shed light in a 30-foot radius for 1 minute. You choose dim, normal, or bright light each time you activate this revelation. As an action, you can create a flash of brilliant light, forcing one creature within 30 feet to succeed at a Dexterity save or be blinded until the end of its next turn. Once you’ve targeted a creature with flare, you can’t target it with this revelation again for 10 minutes. Blind or sightless creatures are not affected by this use of this revelation.

When you create a flash of light as an action and you are attuned or fully attuned to photon mode, you can instead choose to give all enemies within range disadvantage on perception checks (no save) until the end of their next turns.

### Gravity Anchor :eight_pointed_black_star:

As a bonus action, you can form a gravitational bond between yourself and either the surface you’re standing on or the objects you are holding. This grants you advantage on any saves to prevent you from being involuntarily moved, and disadvantage on special attacks that move you if you choose the surface underfoot. It grants advantage on checks to hold onto items if you choose objects. If you’re not in graviton mode, the bonus lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

When you are attuned or fully attuned to graviton mode, you can use your concentration to extend the effect until you leave graviton mode.

When you are attuned or fully attuned to graviton mode, you can activate this revelation as a reaction when targeted by an attack/effect that could be protected by this ability, in which case it defends against only that attack.

### Gravity Boost :eight_pointed_black_star:

You can increase or reduce the gravitational attraction between yourself and the terrain around you. You can add your proficiency bonus (if not proficient) to Strength (Athletics) checks to climb, jump, or swim as part of the action you take to attempt the skill check. In addition, as a reaction when you are falling, you can reduce the falling damage you take by half.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can move along vertical surfaces and even upside down along ceilings during your turn. This functions as [_spider climb_](/magic/spells/spider_climb.md), but it leaves your hands free and you can also run. You must end your movement on a surface that can support you normally. If you end your movement while you are standing on a vertical surface or ceiling, you fall unless you succeed at an Athletics check to climb to remain in position.

### Gravity Hold :eight_pointed_black_star:

This revelation allows you to move objects at a distance as per [_psychokinetic hand_](/magic/spells/mage_hand.html).
When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can use the _psychokinetic hand_ ability of your gravity hold to immobilize, lift, or move a Medium or smaller creature. The creature can attempt a Strength saving throw to negate the effect. While under this effect, the target is grappled. This ability follows all of the restrictions of the spell other than the weight limit, but you can’t lift a creature higher than 5 feet off the ground. You can spend an action in each turn to maintain the gravity hold, and the target can attempt a new save to end the effect. Once a creature successfully saves against this ability, it becomes immune to further uses of this revelation for 24 hours.

### Plasma Sheath :eight_spoked_asterisk:

As a bonus action, you can cause all of your melee attacks to deal fire damage instead of their normal damage type. This benefit lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode.
When you are attuned or fully attuned, your attacks with plasma sheath deal additional fire damage equal to half your level.

### Radiation :eight_spoked_asterisk:

As an action, you can emit an aura of low-level radiation. Creatures within 5 feet of you must succeed at a Constitution save or be poisoned. A creature poisoned this way recovers as soon as it moves out of your aura, and a creature that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to your radiation for 24 hours. This is a poison effect. The radiation lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, the size of your aura increases to 10 feet.

### Stellar Rush :eight_spoked_asterisk:

You gain the Charger feat

When you are attuned or fully attuned, and charging to shove (with at least 10 feet in straight line at the end of the dash) you can burst in flames while doing so. Whether or not you succeed at the bull rush, the target takes 2d6 fire damage (Dexterity save for half). This damage increases by 1d6 at 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter.

## Stellar Revelations (level 6)
The following revelations can only be chosen when you’re at least 6th level
### Astrologic Sense :eight_spoked_asterisk:
### Blazing Orbit:eight_spoked_asterisk:
### Corona:eight_spoked_asterisk:
### Crush:eight_pointed_black_star:
### Defy Gravity :eight_pointed_black_star:
### Glow of Life :eight_spoked_asterisk:
### Gravity Surge :eight_pointed_black_star:
### Hypnotic Glow :eight_spoked_asterisk:
### Reflection :eight_pointed_black_star:
## Stellar Revelations (level 10)
The following revelations can only be chosen when you’re at least 10th level

## Stellar Revelations (level 16)
The following revelations can only be chosen when you’re at least 16th level
### Ultimate Graviton :eight_pointed_black_star:
### Ultimate Photon :eight_spoked_asterisk:

## Zenith Revelations

The following is the full list of Zenith Revelations. All of them require full attunement, and spend the attunement when used.

### Black Hole :eight_pointed_black_star:

When you’re fully graviton-attuned, as an action, you can pull any number of creatures within 20 feet of you closer. You choose which creatures are affected and which ones aren’t. Each target must succeed at a Strength saving throw or be pulled 10 feet toward you. The range of this revelation and the distance pulled increase by 5 feet at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Solid objects do not block this ability, but any creature that runs into a solid object ceases moving closer to you.

### Miniature Star :eight_spoked_asterisk:
### Particle Wave :eight_spoked_asterisk:
### Quantum Entrapment :eight_pointed_black_star:
### Ray of Light :eight_spoked_asterisk:
### Solar Acceleration :eight_spoked_asterisk:
### Starquake :eight_pointed_black_star:
### Supernova :eight_spoked_asterisk:

When you’re fully photon-attuned, as an action, you can deal 1d6 fire damage plus 1d6 additional fire damage per solarian level to all creatures within 10 feet of you. A creature that succeeds at a Dexterity saving throw takes half damage. At 9th level, you can increase the radius to 15 feet, and at 17th level, you can increase the radius to 20 feet.

### Time Dilation :eight_pointed_black_star:
### Wormholes :eight_pointed_black_star:

## Solar Manifestations

### Solar Armor

You can form your solar mote into a suit of armor made out of stellar energy that outlines your body. This armor appears to be made out of glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can take whatever general shape you choose, whether glowing armored plates of solidified stellar energy, a form-fitting suit of crackling energy, or an aura of stellar plasma. Your solar armor’s general design has no impact on its function and doesn’t give the armor any special abilities. Once you’ve selected the general design, you can’t change it until you gain a new solarian level.

Your solar armor grants you a +1 bonus to your AC. This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level. It is compatible with [light armor](/equipment/armor.md#light-armor), but it gives you no benefit if you’re wearing medium or heavy armor. At 5th level, you also gain energy resistance while your solar armor is active. You can choose either cold resistance or fire resistance when you activate the armor, and you can switch energy types as a bonus action. At 15th level it provides you resistance against both kinds of damage. At 20th level you can, as a bonus action, make it immune to either cold or fire.

Forming or dismissing solar armor is a free action.

### Solar Weapon

You can seize your solar mote in one hand to form a melee weapon out of stellar energy. This weapon appears to be made out of glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can be whatever general shape you choose. Normal melee weapons like axes, swords, and spears are most common, but other shapes, such as a large rune of stellar energy, a mass of writhing energy tendrils, or an energized fist that fits over your own hand, are possible as well. Your solar weapon’s general design has no impact on its function, and doesn’t give the weapon any special abilities such as reach.

Your solar weapon functions as a one-handed martial melee weapon, and you’re automatically proficient with it. At 1st level, choose whether your solar weapon deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can change the damage type each time you gain a new solarian level. Your solar weapon deals damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. This damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 10th level, 8d6 at 15th level and 12d6 at 20th level. Solarian weapon crystals can increase your solar weapon’s damage.

Forming or dismissing a solar weapon takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (so can for example be made for free as part of your attack action). Your solar weapon is automatically dismissed if it ever leaves your hand.
