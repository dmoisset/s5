# Envoy (variant bard)

You make your way in the universe with a charming smile, quick wit, and keen sense of self-preservation, and excel at getting 
others to do what you want. You might be a trickster, hustler, or con artist, or you might serve as an actor, ambassador, or 
businessperson, paving the way for negotiation through kind words or the occasional dirty trick. You are often the group’s 
strategist, using your quick wit and tactical acumen to push your friends to greater heights. You may also be skilled in 
diplomacy, serving as the face for a starship crew, talking your way into restricted systems or gaining audiences with local 
politicians or warlords.

Envoys are actually based on the Star5er version of the bard (described below). This class has most of the Bard abilities with the significant difference that it doesn’t grant spellcasting abilities. A character of this class does not gain the **Spellcasting** feature, and she does not gain the **Magical Features** secret. They are replaced by the **Envoy Improvisation** feature that allow some non-magical versatility.

### Envoy Improvisations
At 1st level, and at every even level, you learn an envoy improvisation (see list below) that you qualify for. When you level 
up, you can also change an improvisation for another one that you qualify for.

### Envoy inspiration

You use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That 
creature gains one Envoy Inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, 
or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Envoy Inspiration 
die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Envoy Inspiration die is rolled, it is 
lost. A creature can have only one Envoy Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses 
when you finish a long rest.

Your Envoy Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 
10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

### Spellcasting

You do _NOT_ get access to this Bard feature (no cantrips, slots, or rituals). You do get a Save DC for your abilities that 
is calculated in the usual way (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Charisma). You do not gain bard college features that are tied 
to spellcasting (like “Battle Magic” or “Additional Magical secrets”)

### Jack of All Trades :five:

Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.

### Tis But a Flesh Wound

This ability replaces the Bard “Song of Rest” feature. Beginning at 2nd level, you can pep talk to your wounded allies to 
help revitalizing them during a short rest. If you and any friendly creatures who can hear you regain SP at the end of the 
short rest by spending one RP, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 HP. Once a creature has benefited from this 
ability, it can not do so again until they finish a long rest.
The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and 
to 1d12 at 17th level.

### Expertise

At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that 
uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.

### Envoy College

Envoys get access to different colleges, described below. Right now only the “College of Expertise” is described. Envoy 
Colleges grant you features at 3th, 6th, 10th, 14th and 18th level.

### Ability Score Increase :five:

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Font of Inspiration :five:

Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Envoy Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.

### Countercharm :five:

At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, 
you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures 
within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear 
you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no 
action required).

### Magical Secrets

You do not get access to this feature. Envoy Colleges  may give you a Bard College feature instead at 10th 
level and 18th level.

### Superior Inspiration :five:

At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Envoy Inspiration left, you regain one use.

## Envoy Improvisations

Icons next to the improvisations may indicate the following:
 * :speech_balloon: the ally target must be able to understand your words
 * :thinking: the ally/target must have a mind that can be affected (mindless creatures/automatons or magically protected minds stop this ability)
 * :ear: the ally/target must be able to see you/hear you


### Level 1

Any envoy can take these improvisations

#### Clever Feint :ear:

Choose an enemy within 60 feet. As an action you get advantage on your attacks until the end of your next turn. The target 
must succeed at an Intelligence saving throw or your allies also have advantage on the first attack they make before the end 
of your next turn. This improvisation only works against intelligent creatures.

At 6th level you can spend 1 RP to make a saving throw that succeeded against this improvisation count as a fail.

#### Dispiriting Taunt :speech_balloon: :thinking: :ear:

Choose an enemy within 60 feet. As an action you give the enemy disadvantage on its attacks until the end of your next turn.

At 6th level you can spend 1 RP to make a saving throw that succeeded against this improvisation count as a fail.

#### Don’t Quit :thinking: :ear:

Choose an ally within 60 feet. As an action, you suppress a condition on that ally until the beginning of your next turn. 
The condition can be: frightened, charmed, poisoned, or a single level of fatigue. At 6th level, you can also remove the 
paralyzed and stunned conditions.

#### Expanded Attunement

Your mind-affecting improvisations can affect creatures that would be immune for not having a mind like robots/automatons, 
mindless undead, etc.

#### Get ‘Em :speech_balloon: :thinking: :ear:

As a bonus action, choose an enemy within 60 ft. You and your allies gain an extra 1d4 on attack rolls against that enemy 
until the beginning of your next turn.

At 6th level, you can spend one RP to apply this bonus against all enemies within 60 ft and also add 1d4 to damage rolls 
(same damage type as the original weapon).

#### Inspiring Boost :speech_balloon: :thinking: :ear:

As an action choose an ally within 30 ft. The ally must have taken damage since your last turn ended. Roll an inspiration

After you take a short rest, allies that rested with you gain advantage to their Wis(Perception) checks and initiative rolls 
for 1 hour.

#### Not in the Face :ear:

As a bonus action choose an enemy within 60 feet. The enemy must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage in 
all its attacks against you until the end of your next turn. At 6th level you can spend one RP when declaring this action to 
negate your enemy the chance of a saving throw.

#### Universal Expression

When using a language-dependent improvisation that affects an enemy, you can use the improvisation against that enemy even 
if the two of you do not share a language.

#### Watch Your Step :speech_balloon: :thinking: :ear:

When an ally within 60ft is about to roll a Dexterity saving throw, you can spend your reaction before the attempt to give 
your ally a bonus 1d4 on that throw. At 6th level you can spend 1 RP to also give your ally advantage on the saving throw

### Level 4

These improvisations can be chosen starting at 4th level

#### Clever Attack

As an action you can use the Clever Feint improvisation and then make a single attack in the same action. You must have the 
Clever Feint improvisation before choosing this.

#### Duck Under

If you have taken the Dodge action in the last turn, and an enemy misses you with a melee attack, as a reaction you can move 
the enemy 5ft to another point within your reach.

#### Focus :thinking: :ear:

As an action, you can choose an ally within 60 ft. The ally must be affected by one or more effects giving her disadvantage 
on attack rolls. You give that ally advantage, (effectively negating the disadvantage) until the end of your next turn.

#### Hurry :thinking: :ear:

As an action, you double the speed of an ally within 60 feet until the end of her next turn.

#### Quick Dispiriting Taunt

declared before the roll total is announced. Your ally can use her reaction to fall prone and to give the attacker 
disadvantage on the attack roll. At 8th level you can spend 1 RP to prevent your ally from falling prone (while still 
imposing disadvantage on the attack roll)

### Level 6

These improvisations can be chosen starting at 6th level

#### Clever Improvisations

The first time you would spend Resolve Points on one of your envoy improvisations, reduce the cost by 1 Resolve Point 
(minimum 0). This ability refreshes whenever you take a short or long rest, reducing the Resolve Point cost of your next 
envoy improvisation after the rest.

#### Draw Fire :ear:

As an action, you can impose disadvantage on attack rolls that target anyone but you on any enemies within 100ft until the 
end of your next turn.

#### Heads Up :speech_balloon: :ear:

When you succeed at a Wis(Perception) check, as a reaction, you can signal a single ally within 60 feet. That ally can act 
as if he had also succeeded at the Wis(Perception) check with the same result.

#### Improved Get ‘Em

The bonus from get ‘em increases to 1d6. You can also use an action where you gain the benefits of get ‘em and then as a

as an action and spend a Resolve Point to grant an additional action instead of speed.

#### Situational Awareness

After using the ready action and before the effect is triggered, you can spend 1 RP to change the trigger and the chosen 
reaction. If your readied action was a spell, you still spend the slot for the spell you started to cast.

#### Sustained Determination :speech_balloon: :thinking: :ear:

As a bonus action you can spend 2 RP to grant an ally within 60 ft 1 RP that she can spend before the beginning of your next 
turn (or lose if not spent). You can not use this improvisation on the same ally again until you finish a long rest.

## College of Expertise (Bard College)

An envoy can choose this college at third level as an Ennvoy College option. This college allows the Envoy to unlock certain 
talents related to the skills they chose as part of their Expertise feature.

### Expertise Talent

At 3th, 6th, 10th, 14th and 18th level you gain an expertise talent from the list below. The talent must be tied to a skill 
that you have expertise in (you may take the expertise skill at the same level that you pick the talent). You can instead, 
only once per character, choose to gain another expertise skill instead of an expertise talent.

Note that not all skills have associated talents; make sure to choose on your Expertise skills that allow you to benefit 
from this feature.

Some talent descriptions ask you to make a “non-expert skill check”, which means adding your proficiency bonus once instead 
of twice to gain the benefit of the talent instead.

#### Altered Bearing (Deception)

As an action, you can make a non-expert DC 10 Cha(Deception) check to alter minor details of your appearance to be harder to 
recognize. Wisdom (Perception) checks to note who you are or to recognize you later are done at disadvantage.

#### Analyst (Insight)

When using Wisdom (Insight) you never get false information (but you can get a “you’re not sure” if you fail).

#### Convincing Liar (Deception)

After rolling a Cha(Deception) check you can choose to consider it a non-expert check, but instead roll an additional d20 
and choose which one to use. At 10th level you can choose to spend a resolve point and not lose the expertise bonus.

#### Cultural Savant (Culture)

If you’re trying to use Int(Culture) skill to recall something and have enough time, you can take a few minutes to get a 
result equivalent to having rolled a 20 on a non-expert check.

#### Cunning Disguise (Deception)

When you are disguised or attempting to pass as somebody else, you can make a non-expert check, and instead the first time 
that a creature would have the chance to see through it, treat its Wis(Perception) or Wis(Insight) check as if it had been a 
natural 1. This happens once per disguise, or twice after 10th level.

#### Engineering Adept (Engineering)

When repairing or disabling a device you can make a non-expert Int(Engineering) check to take half the time it would 
normally take.

#### Expert Forger (Computers)

You can forge a document using an Int(Computers) check as an action, instead of the few minutes that it would normally take.

#### Fast Hack (Computers)

When hacking a computer you can make a non-expert Int(Engineering) check to take half the time it would normally take 
(minimum 1 action). At 10th level, on a success you negate a single countermeasure of the target system. You can not use 
this to negate another countermeasure in the same system until your next long rest.

#### Inspired Medic (Medicine)

After rolling an Int(Medicine) check you can choose to consider it a non-expert check, but instead roll an additional d20 
and choose which one to use. At 10th level you can choose to spend a resolve point and not lose the expertise bonus.

#### Keen Observer (Insight)

When interacting for a minute with a creature under a charm, enchantment, or other form of mind influence, the GM can allow 
a non-expert Wis(Insight) check to learn about it. The GM may roll this in secret.

#### Menacing Gaze (Intimidate)

As an action, you can choose enemies within a 60 foot cone. They must succeed in a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened 
until the beginning of your next turn. Additional uses of this talent against the same creature are ineffective until you 
take a long rest.

#### Rattling Presence (Intimidate)

You can choose an enemy within 30 feet to demoralize. The enemy must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened 
(although this frightened effect does not prevent it from moving towards you) for 2 rounds, or 4 rounds if you are 10th 
level or higher.

#### Skilled Linguist (Culture)

When choosing this talent, you gain three languages of your choice. You can also use a non-expert Int(Culture) checks to try 
to decode half a page of a cyphered text as an action (it would normally take a few minutes)

#### Slick Customer (Culture)

After rolling an Cha(Persuasion) check you can choose to consider it a non-expert check, but instead roll an additional d20 
and choose the best roll. At 10th level you can choose to spend a resolve point and not lose the expertise bonus.

#### Student of Technology (Engineering)

If you’re trying to use Int(Engineering) skill to identify technological creatures or technology and have enough time, you 
can take a few minutes to get a result equivalent to having rolled a 20 on a non-expert check. If the technology was 
manufactured by a group or individual you’re familiar with (corporations, military organizations), you recognize who crafted 
it.

#### Surgeon (Medicine)

You can use Medicine to treat deadly wounds on a patient once each day in addition to the normal allowances for the medical 
equipment you are using. Because performing this level of advanced medicine is difficult and time consuming, the DC for this 
additional treatment increases by 5 and the skill check takes 1 hour.

#### Well Informed (Persuasion)

When you’ve been in a populated area at least 24 hours you can use a non-expert Cha(Persuasion) skill check to find out 
local events/rumors (or who to ask about some topic) as an action instead of a few hours
