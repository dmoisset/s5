# Mystic

You understand that what most people call magic is simply an expression of the innate connection between all things, and you intuitively tap into this unseen power to create strange effects. You may conceptualize the source of your magic as divine grace, a manipulation of fundamental energy, or an unlocking of psychic potential, but always with the knowledge that you are a conduit channeling forces greater than yourself. Though you may study, you understand that spellcasting—like all existence—is messy and intuitive, and you specialize in biology and mental systems too complex to be perfectly understood by science. You sense the intangible and exploit your bonds with others, whether to bolster them or bend them to your will.

### Equipment

You start with the following equipment in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

*   (a) A tactical baton or (b) a battle staff
*   (a) laser pistol, azimuth with a 20 charges battery or (b) pulsecaster pistol with a 20 charges battery.
*   A second skin armor
*   An essential kit

### Spells

Your connection grants you the intuition to produce magical effects.

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the mystic spell list. You learn additional mystic 
cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Mystic table.

#### Spell Slots

The Mystic table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these mystic spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *Cure Wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *Cure Wounds* using either slot.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the mystic spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Mystic table shows when you learn more mystic spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 4th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the mystic spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer mystic list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your mystic spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to link your intuition and your connection. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a mystic spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Connection

You have a mysterious connection with some force that grants you magical powers. The exact nature of your connection can vary widely, and even mystics who share the same connection may interpret it differently. You must pick one connection upon taking your first level of mystic—once made, this choice can’t be changed. [Connections](#connections) you can choose are listed below.

Many mystics serve as priests of various gods, and while you can theoretically choose any type of connection with any entity or concept, deities rarely grant connections that don’t fit within their ethos (for example, Weydan, the god of freedom, is unlikely to look kindly on overlords). As such, each connection lists the deities and philosophies commonly associated with it.

#### Connection Powers

At 1st level, 3rd level, and every 3 levels thereafter, you gain a connection power unique to your connection. If a connection power allows a saving throw to resist its effects, it uses your Spell save DC.

#### Connection Spells

Your connection grants you additional spells known, one for each level of mystic spell you can cast, starting at 1st level and at any level when you normally gain access to a new spell level. These spells are in addition to the spells known listed on the Mystic table above. These spells can’t be exchanged for different spells at higher levels. The spell level of each spell is listed in your connection’s entry.

### Healing Touch

Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes to magically heal an ally up to 5 Hit Points per mystic level.

### Channel Skill

At 2nd level, you draw strange feelings, instincts, knowledge, and urges from your connection, augmenting your prowess in certain tasks. Each connection has two skills associated with it. You must choose one of them and you get proficient on skill checks for that skill.

### Mindlink

Starting at 2nd level, you are able to form a mental link with creatures you touch, communicating information rapidly through it. You can use *Mind Link* at will as a special ability; you can use it on multiple individuals, but once you use it on a creature you must take a long rest before being able to use it again on the same creature.

### Intuitive Spells

When you get to 5th level, you can cast your 1st and 2nd level [connection spells](#connection-spells) once each without spending a spell slot. You recover your ability to do this after a long rest.

### Telepathic Bond

At 11th level, you can as an action form a telepathic link with up to eight other willing creatures, allowing you to communicate telepathically at great distances. This functions as *telepathic bond*, except the duration is permanent. You can have only one telepathic bond active in this way at any given time; creating a new telepathic bond immediately ends the previous one.

### Telepathic Sense

Once you get to 14th level, you can detect and locate creatures within 30 feet that have emotions, as if you had blindsense. A creature aware of this can keep its emotions calm to avoid detection by this ability by succeeding at a Charisma (Deception) check with a DC equal to your passive Insight score, but some strong mental effects or emotions can stop them from hiding their minds. Creatures under the effects of magic against detection or similar effects automatically avoid detection by this ability. Unless otherwise stated, constructs and creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or lower don’t have emotions and can’t be sensed this way.

### Transcendence

Once you reach 17th level, you are close to becoming one with your connection. You learn how to temporarily transcend your physical form. Once after each long rest, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to project your consciousness outside of your physical body in the form of an intangible psychic image of yourself. This counts as a 6th-level illusion effect and lasts for 1 minute. While your consciousness is projected, your physical body is considered blinded, deafened, and paralyzed, but you can return to your body as a bonus action. You control your psychic image as though it was your own body, and your senses perceive only what the image can see and hear. You move with a fly speed of 60 feet. You can pass through solid objects as though you were incorporeal, but you can’t go completely into a solid object. You can’t directly affect physical objects. Your projected consciousness is immune to most attacks or effects, whether or not they affect incorporeal creatures, but mind affecting effects or attacks dealing psychic damage have their full effect on you.

You can cast any mystic spell or spell-like ability with a range of touch or greater from your projected consciousness. The spells affect other targets normally. You can’t cast any spells on your projected consciousness except for illusion spells. You need not maintain line of effect to your projected consciousness, but if you cross into another plane, even momentarily (including via Drift travel), your mind immediately returns to your physical body.

### Improved Intuitive Spells

At 19th level, you can use your [Intuitive Spells](#intuitive-spells) feature to cast each of your connection spells once, not just the 1st and second level ones.

### Enlightenment

You achieve enlightenment, becoming a living incarnation of your connection. You no longer age, nor do you die of old age. Once per day as a bonus action, you can enter a state of total communion with your connection that lasts for 1 minute. During this time, you gain advantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, ability and skill checks, and you gain 20 temporary Resolve Points that you can use only on connection powers. Any unspent temporary Resolve Points disappear at the end of this minute. In addition, once per week, you can cast *miracle* as a spell-like ability.

## Connections

The following represent the most common mystic connections

### Akashic

You’re linked to the collective knowledge of every sentient species that ever lived that’s held in the Akashic Record, an Astral library of perfect psychic records of every moment in history. You might be an ancient lorekeeper, an inquisitive student of the occult, an intuitive consulting detective, or a secret-hoarding spy.

**Associated Deities:** Eloritu, Nyarlathotep, Pharasma, Talavet, Triune, Weydan, Yaraesa    
**Associated Skills:** Culture and Mysticism    
**Spells:** 1st - _Identify_, 2nd - _Augury_, 3rd - _Tongues_, 4th - _Divination_, 5th - _Contact Other Plane_, 6th - _Find the Path_, 7th - _Foresight_ **SWITCH TO 7TH instead of 9TH**

#### Akashic Knowledge (1st Level)

You gain the [Channel Skill](#channel-skill) ability at 1st level (instead of 2nd level). After each short rest, you can tap into the Akashic Record, enabling you to choose one tool proficiency or language and be proficient in that until your next long rest.

#### Access Akashic Record (3rd Level)

You can access the Akashic Record to augment your skills. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to attempt a skill check as if you were proficient in that skill.

#### Peer into the Future (6th Level)

While you rest you receive visions of possible futures. You can declare that you are using the benefit of this ability before rolling one ability check, saving throw, or skill check, and you gain advantage on that check. You must take a long rest before doing this again.

At 12th level, you can use this ability twice. 

#### Mind Probe (9th Level)

You can use *mind probe* as a spell-like ability once, lasting for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves against your mind probe is immune to further uses of this ability for 24 hours. You recover this ability after a short rest

#### Telepathic Memories (Su) (12th Level)

You can share memories at will with allies linked by your [telepathic bond](#telepathic-bond) class feature. As an action action, you or a linked ally can send a memory of up to 1 minute to as many others in the bond as they choose. Sending a relevant memory counts as a successful aid another attempt for a skill check, even if you wouldn’t otherwise be able to use aid another.

#### Memory Palace (15th Level)

You assemble an extradimensional library to house mental constructs representing your accumulated knowledge. Once betwen long rests you choose where its one entrance is located within 300 ft. The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you create the entrance can enter the extradimensional library as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is Invisible. Anyone inside can open the entrance and exit the memory palace at will. The only way to enter and exit the memory palace is via the entrance; even *plane shift* and similar magic do not access it.

You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can't exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm. There is no furniture other than bookcases, computers, and a few desks and sofas. A staff of 10 near-transparent servants attends all who enter as librarians. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can't Attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. The servants can go anywhere in the library but can't leave it. Furnishings and other Objects created as part of the palace dissipate into smoke if removed from it. The memory palace keeps the same layout each time you access it, though you can alter its appearance each time you gain a level or by spending 15 minutes concentrating—you don’t need to be inside it to alter it.

When you gain this ability, choose one skill that can be used to recall knowledge. Consulting your memory palace gives anyone who studies within—including you—advantage to skill checks to recall knowledge of that type, and creatures inside the memory palace can attempt checks of that type untrained. At 16th level, and at each level thereafter, choose another skill that can be used with to recall knowledge to which your memory palace’s advantage applies.

#### Glean Spell (18th Level)

Once per day, you can delve into the Akashic Record to cast a spell from either the mystic or technomancer spell list as if it were on your list of spells known. The spell consumes a spell slot 1 level higher than the level of the spell.

### Empath

Your connection helps you sense emotions and notice details others can’t. You might be a diplomat, an investigator, a mind-reading bodyguard, a ship’s psychologist, or a psychic con artist.

**Associated Deities:** Abadar, Hylax, Iomedae, Sarenrae, Talavet, Triune (Casandalee)    
**Associated Skills:** Insight and Perception    
**Spells:** 1st - Detect Thoughts **need a 1st level version**, 2nd - Zone of Truth, 3rd - Clairaudience/clairvoyance, 4th - Mind Probe, 5th - Telepathy (**need a 5th level version**), 6th - True Seeing, 7th - Antipathy / Sympathy **Move to 7th**

#### Empathy (1st Level)

As an action, you can attempt a Wisdom (Insight) check to read the emotions of a particular creature (vs its passive Deception bonus). If you succeed, you learn its general disposition and attitude toward creatures within 30 feet of it, and you gain advantage in Charisma based skill checks against that creature for 1 hour. Whether you succeed or fail, after opening your mind to read emotions, you get disadvantage on saving throws against mind-affecting effects for 1 minute.

#### Greater Mindlink (3rd Level)

You can use your mindlink ability on the same creature as many times as you wish, and the communication can be both ways, though the maximum of 10 minutes of communication per round still applies.

#### Emotionsense (6th Level)

You gain the [Telepathic Sense](#telepathic-sense) at 6th level instead of 14th.

#### Discern Lies (9th Level)

You can use *discern lies* as a spell-like ability, targeting a single creature. This effect lasts 1 round. Once a creature successfully saves against this ability, it becomes immune to further uses of this ability for 24 hours. Once you've used this you must take a short rest before doing it again.

#### Greater Emotionsense (12th Level)

Your [Telepathic Sense](#telepathic-sense) counts as blindsight instead of blindsense

#### Retrocognition (15th Level)

You can use *retrocognition* as a spell-like ability at will. When doing so, you have disadvantage to saving throws against mind-affecting effects for as long as you concentrate on *retrocognition* and an equal amount of time afterward. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to negate this penalty.

#### Empathic Mastery (18th Level)

You can spend 1 Resolve Point to use *psychic surgery* as a spell-like ability. If you are incapacitated by an effect that *psychic surgery* could remove and have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use this ability on yourself, even without being able to take any actions.

### Healer

Your connection channels the life force of all things—as well as its counterpart, death. You’re an expert healer, but not necessarily a selfless one. You might be a traveling doctor, a haunted medium, a military medic, or a tyrannical necromancer.

**Associated Deities:** Desna, Hylax, Iomedae, Pharasma, Sarenrae, Talavet, Urgathoa, Weydan    
**Associated Skills:** Medicine and Mysticism    
**Spells:** 1st _Cure Wounds_; 2nd - _Lesser Restoration_, 3rd - _Revivify_, 4th - _Death Ward_, 5th - _Greater Restoration_, 6th - _Heal_, 7th - _Regenerate_

#### Healing Channel (1st Level)

You can heal yourself and your allies. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to channel this energy. Healing yourself with channeled energy is a bonus action, healing an ally you touch is an action, and healing all allies within 30 feet uses your action and your bonus action. This energy restores 2d8 Hit Points plus your Wisdom modifier and increases by 1d8 at 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter.

#### Lifelink (3rd Level)

At the start of each turn, you can choose an ally within 30 feet who has taken Hit Point damage and transfer her wounds to yourself, dealing an amount of damage up to your mystic level to your Hit Points (bypassing any Stamina Points you may have) and healing the ally’s Hit Points an equal amount. This doesn’t require any action on your part. You can’t prevent or reduce the damage you take from lifelink.

#### Healer’s Bond (6th Level)

As an action, you can form a bond with up to three allies, allowing you to constantly sense their condition as per the *status* spell. This bond lasts until dispelled or until you create a new healer’s bond, which immediately ends the previous one. At 11th level, when you gain the telepathic bond class feature, you also gain the effects of status on all creatures linked by your telepathic bond.

#### Steal Life (9th Level)

As an action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to steal part of a creature’s life force and transfer it to yourself or others. You must touch the target (requiring a successful melee spell attack), which deals 5d8 necrotic damage. Choose an ally within 30 feet; that ally recovers an amount of Hit Points equal to the damage dealt (to a maximum of the foe’s remaining Hit Points). Alternatively, you can heal yourself instead, but you restore only a number of Hit Points equal to half the damage dealt. If this heals the recipient (you or your ally) up to maximum Hit Points, any excess persists for 1 hour as temporary Hit Points. If your attack misses, you don’t lose the Resolve Point.

#### Channel Bond (12th Level)

When you use healing channel to heal an ally, you can heal any ally linked by your telepathic bond class feature as if you were touching that ally, as long as the ally is within 120 feet. When you use healing channel to heal a group of allies, it heals all allies linked by your telepathic bond class feature within 120 feet (as well as all other allies within 30 feet).

#### Channel Life (15th Level)

If you use healing channel on a creature that has died within 1 round, you can bring it back to life as per a *revivify* spell.

#### Deny Death (18th Level)

You are immune to death effects. If you would normally die from damage, as long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining, you can immediately spend all of your remaining Resolve Points to instead stay alive. If your Hit Points would have been reduced to 0, you now have 1 Hit Point instead. Once you use this ability, you can’t regain Resolve Points again until you take a long rest, even if you have another means to do so.

### Mindbreaker

You use your raw will and understanding of the mind’s structure to crush and demoralize your enemies. You might be a special ops assassin, a psychic interrogator, or a righteous military crusader breaking the enemy’s spirit on the battlefield.

**Associated Deities:** Besmara, Damoritosh, Iomedae, The Devourer, Urgathoa, Zon-Kuthon    
**Associated Skills:** Deception and Intimidation    
**Spells:** 1st - Confusion, Lesser **?????? command?**, 2nd - Inflict Pain **??????**, 3rd - Synaptic Pulse **?????**, 4th - Confusion, 5th - Hold Monster, 6th - Eyebite, 7th- Feeblemind **Move from 8th**

#### Share Pain (1st Level)

Whenever a foe deals damage to you, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to shift some of the pain back onto that foe. Unless the foe succeeds at a Wisdom saving throw, reduce the damage you take from the attack by your mystic level (to a maximum of the attack’s damage), and the foe takes an equal amount of psychic damage. This is a mind-affecting effect.

#### Backlash (3rd Level)

Whenever a foe succeeds at a Wisdom saving throw against one of your spells and completely negates the effect, you can use your reaction to make that foe take 1 psychic damage for each mystic level you have. The damage count as non-lethal (it can not kill a creature) This is a mind-affecting effect.

#### Sow Doubt (6th Level)

As an action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to create uncertainty in the mind of a foe within 30 feet. You choose whether the target gets a 1d4 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks. The effect lasts for as long as you can hold concentration or 1 minute maximum. If the target succeeds at a Wisdom saving throw it can reduce the duration until the beginning of your next turn. A creature can be affected only by one sow doubt effect. This is a mind-affecting effect.

#### Mental Anguish (9th Level)

As a standard action, you can tweak the pain centers in the brain of a foe within 60 feet, causing it to suffer intense agony. The target must succeed at a Wisdom Saving throw or be poisoned for 1 round. If it's concentrating, it also must succeed at a Concentration save vs your spell save DC to hold concentration. Regardless of the save, the creature becomes immune to this ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect.

#### Mindbreaking Link (Su) - 12th Level

Whenever you or an ally linked by your telepathic bond class feature scores a critical hit against a foe, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to confuse that foe. The foe must succeed at a Wisdom saving throw or become confused for 1 round. Whether or not it succeeds at this save, the target is affected by your [sow doubt](#sow-doubt) ability until the end of your next turn. This is a mind-affecting effect.

#### Mindkiller (15th Level)

As an action, you can mold the subconscious fear of a foe within 60 feet into a psychic image of the most disturbing creature imaginable to the target. Only the target can see the mindkiller, and if the target succeeds at a Wisdom saving throw to recognize the image as unreal, the mindkiller has no effect. If the target fails this save, the mindkiller touches the target, which must then succeed at a Charisma save or take 4d10+30 psychic damage. On a successful Charisma save, the target instead takes 3d6 damage. Once a creature succeeds at either save against this ability, it becomes immune to this ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect.

#### Explode Head (18th Level)

You can spend 1 Resolve Point as an action to psychically assault the brain of a foe within 60 feet, causing incredible pressure to build in its head. If the target has 20 Hit Points or fewer, its head explodes, instantly killing the target and spreading debris in a 10-foot radius. Each creature in the area must succeed at a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 slashing damage from the flying debris. A target with more than 20 Hit Points takes 20d6 psychic damage but can attempt a Constitution save to take only half damage. If this damage would reduce the target to 0 HP, the target’s head explodes as described above. This ability works only on a creature that has a head and would die from the loss of a head.

### Overlord

You realize that not all connections are symmetrical, and seek to be the dominant force in any situation. You aren’t necessarily evil; perhaps you consider yourself a benevolent philosophermonarch who takes control for the good of your charges. You might also be a cult leader, a criminal mastermind, or a hypnotist.

**Associated Deities:** Abadar, Besmara, Damoritosh, Lao Shu Po, Zon-Kuthon    
**Associated Skills:** Intimidation and Persuasion    
**Spells:** 1st - Command, 2nd - Hold Person, 3rd - Suggestion **move from level 2?** , 4th - Confusion, 5th - Modify Memory, 6th - Suggestion, Mass, 7th- Dominate Monster **Move from 8th to 7th**

#### Inexplicable Commands (1st Level)

When one of your mind-affecting enchantment spells or spell-like abilities ends, the target loses all memory that it was magically controlled or influenced. That creature still remembers the actions it took, but may be confused by them.

#### Forced Amity (3rd Level)

You can spend 1 Resolve Point as an action to shunt positive emotions and thoughts through your connection, forcing a humanoid creature to become friendly to you for a time. This functions as *charm person*.

#### Echoes of Obedience (6th Level)

Even creatures that resist your dominance can’t shake the lingering echoes of your mind. When a creature succeeds at a saving throw against one of your mind-affecting charm or compulsion spells or spell-like abilities and negates the effect, it takes disadvantage in its next attack roll or skill check that happens before the beginning of your next turn. This is a mind-affecting effect.

#### Greater Forced Amity (9th Level)

Your [forced amity](#forced-amity) ability functions as *charm monster*.

#### Jealous Overlord (12th Level)

When an ally linked by your telepathic bond class feature is subject to mind-affecting effect that issues commands, as a reaction you can issue a countermand allowing the linked ally to act normally. When you do the originator of the mind-affecting effect must attempt a Charisma saving throw vs your spell save DC; if you succeed, your ally can act normally.

#### Forceful Commands (15th Level)

When you use a mind-affecting charm or compulsion spell or spell-like ability against a target benefiting from an active spell that protects against your attack, you automatically become aware of the presence of such defenses, and can spend 1 Resolve Point as part of casting the spell to attempt a spellcasting check to dispel the highest-level such spell, as if you had cast *dispel magic*.

#### Absolute Control (18th Level)

When you issue a command to a dominated creature that would force it to act against its nature, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to deny it a new saving throw against your domination. The dominated creature still won’t carry out an obviously self-destructive order.

#### Starlight Form (3rd Level)

You can transform yourself into blazing starlight as an action. Your body sheds normal light in a 30-foot radius, and you gain the benefits of partial cover. At 7th level, a creature that ends its turn adjacent to your starlight form must succeed at a Constitution save or be blinded until the end of its enxt turn. You can maintain your starlight form for 10 minutes; this duration does not need to be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Once you've used your 10 minutes you must take a long rest to regain this ability. You can forgo the ability's cover and blinding aspects to instead simply shed light, though this still counts against the ability’s duration for the day.

#### Stargazer (6th Level)

You can study the stars to gain a bit of good luck. Twice, if you are outdoors and can see the stars, you can reroll an additional d20 for an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. This reroll can be declared after the dice is rolled, but not after the results have been declared by the GM. You must take a long rest before reusing this ability.

#### Starflight (9th Level)

While in starlight form, you gain the ability to fly as per the *fly* spell.

#### Starry Bond (12th Level)

You can share the good fortune of your [stargazer](#stargazer) class feature with your allies. Whenever an ally linked by your telepathic bond class feature rolls am ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to enable your ally to reroll the failed check.

#### Meteor Shower (Su) - 15th Level

You can spend 1 Resolve Point as an action to call down a rain of meteorites in a 10-foot-radius vertical cylinder, 40 feet high, at a range of up to 250 feet.

At 18th level, once per day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as an action to use _interplanetary teleport_ as a spell-like ability.

#### Speak with Animals (1st Level)

You can communicate with any creature of the animal type, though this doesn’t make it friendly. If an animal is friendly toward you, it may do you favors. This ability allows you to use Intimidate to bully animals, and you can use any other language-dependent effect against animals.

#### Grasping Vines (3rd Level)

You can spend 1 Resolve Point as an action to cause grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within 90ft. While you concentrate (up to 1 minute), these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.
A creature in the area when you cast the spell, entering the area, or starting its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the effect ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
When the effect ends, the conjured plants wilt away.

#### Animal Adaptation (6th Level)

As an action, you can modify your body. Choose one of the following to gain the noted benefit: elongated legs (increase your land speed by 10 feet), fins and webbed digits (granting you a swim speed equal to half your land speed), suckers on wrists and feet (granting you a climb speed equal to half your land speed), or vertical-slit pupils (granting you darkvision 60 feet). This ability lasts for a 1 minute; you can do this again after a short rest. Your base form and size are largely unchanged, but some of your body parts are altered. Armor and gear you are wearing adjusts to your new shape for the duration of this ability. You can have only one of these adaptations active at a time; choosing a new adaptation is an action and the new choice replaces the old. At 12th level, the climb and swim speeds granted by your adaptation are equal to your land speed, and you add wings (granting you a fly speed of 30 feet) to the list of possible adaptations.

#### Reactive Resistance (9th Level)

The first time after a long rest you would take energy (acid, fire, electricity, cold, sonic) damage, you immediately gain resistance to that damage type until your next long rest. If you are damaged by more than one energy type simultaneously, choose which type you resist.

#### Share Resistance (12th Level)

As an action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to grant allies linked by your telepathic bond class feature resistance to the same energy type that you can resist through your [reactive resistance](#reactive-resistance) class feature for 1 minute. You can’t use this ability if your reactive resistance class feature has not yet been activated for the day.

#### Plant Transport (15th Level)

Once per day as an action, you can enter any living plant equal to your size or larger and exit from another plant of the same kind in the same solar system, regardless of the distance separating the two. The destination plant does not need to be familiar to you. If you are uncertain of the location of a particular kind of destination plant, you merely designate direction and distance and this ability moves you as close as possible to the desired location. If a particular destination plant is desired but the plant is not living, this ability fails and you are ejected from the entry plant. You cannot travel through plant creatures. You can bring along objects as long as their bulk doesn’t exceed your Strength score. You can also bring up to eight willing Medium or smaller creatures (each carrying no more bulk than their Strength scores) with you, provided they are linked to you with joined hands.

#### Guided Rebirth (18th Level)

As long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining, you can spend all your remaining Resolve Points as an action to surround yourself with an organic cocoon. While enclosed in the cocoon, you are considered paralyzed. Eight hours later, you emerge having changed your type to animal, humanoid (of any subtype), or your original type, gaining superficial physical characteristics as appropriate. This change does not alter your ability scores, Hit Points, Stamina Points, saving throws, or proficiencies. Each time you make this transformation, you are cleansed of all poisons and diseases, are restored to full Hit Points and Stamina Points, and heal all ability damage. You must select a type other than your current type every time you make the transformation. You can use this ability once per long rest. Once you use this ability, you can’t regain Resolve Points until you take a long rest, even if you have another means to do so.
