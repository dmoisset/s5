# Mystic

You understand that what most people call magic is simply an expression of the innate connection between all things, and you intuitively tap into this unseen power to create strange effects. You may conceptualize the source of your magic as divine grace, a manipulation of fundamental energy, or an unlocking of psychic potential, but always with the knowledge that you are a conduit channeling forces greater than yourself. Though you may study, you understand that spellcasting—like all existence—is messy and intuitive, and you specialize in biology and mental systems too complex to be perfectly understood by science. You sense the intangible and exploit your bonds with others, whether to bolster them or bend them to your will.

*   An essential kit

### Spells

Your connection grants you the intuition to produce magical effects.

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the mystic spell list. You learn additional mystic 
cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Mystic table.

#### Spell Slots

The Mystic table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these mystic spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *Cure Wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *Cure Wounds* using either slot.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the mystic spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Mystic table shows when you learn more mystic spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 4th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the mystic spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer mystic list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your mystic spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to link your intuition and your connection. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a mystic spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Connection

You have a mysterious connection with some force that grants you magical powers. The exact nature of your connection can vary widely, and even mystics who share the same connection may interpret it differently. You must pick one connection upon taking your first level of mystic—once made, this choice can’t be changed. [Connections](#connections) you can choose are listed below.

Many mystics serve as priests of various gods, and while you can theoretically choose any type of connection with any entity or concept, deities rarely grant connections that don’t fit within their ethos (for example, Weydan, the god of freedom, is unlikely to look kindly on overlords). As such, each connection lists the deities and philosophies commonly associated with it.

#### Connection Powers

At 1st level, 3rd level, and every 3 levels thereafter, you gain a connection power unique to your connection. If a connection power allows a saving throw to resist its effects, it uses your Spell save DC.

#### Connection Spells

Your connection grants you additional spells known, one for each level of mystic spell you can cast, starting at 1st level and at any level when you normally gain access to a new spell level. These spells are in addition to the spells known listed on the Mystic table above. These spells can’t be exchanged for different spells at higher levels. The spell level of each spell is listed in your connection’s entry.

### Healing Touch

Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes to magically heal an ally up to 5 Hit Points per mystic level.

### Channel Skill

At 2nd level, you draw strange feelings, instincts, knowledge, and urges from your connection, augmenting your prowess in certain tasks. Each connection has two skills associated with it. You must choose one of them and you get proficient on skill checks for that skill.

### Mindlink

Starting at 2nd level, you are able to form a mental link with creatures you touch, communicating information rapidly through it. You can use *Mind Link* at will as a special ability; you can use it on multiple individuals, but once you use it on a creature you must take a long rest before being able to use it again on the same creature.

### Intuitive Spells

When you get to 5th level, you can cast your 1st and 2nd level [connection spells](#connection-spells) once each without spending a spell slot. You recover your ability to do this after a long rest.

### Telepathic Bond

At 11th level, you can as an action form a telepathic link with up to eight other willing creatures, allowing you to communicate telepathically at great distances. This functions as *telepathic bond*, except the duration is permanent. You can have only one telepathic bond active in this way at any given time; creating a new telepathic bond immediately ends the previous one.

### Telepathic Sense

Once you get to 14th level, you can detect and locate creatures within 30 feet that have emotions, as if you had blindsense. A creature aware of this can keep its emotions calm to avoid detection by this ability by succeeding at a Charisma (Deception) check with a DC equal to your passive Insight score, but some strong mental effects or emotions can stop them from hiding their minds. Creatures under the effects of magic against detection or similar effects automatically avoid detection by this ability. Unless otherwise stated, constructs and creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or lower don’t have emotions and can’t be sensed this way.

### Transcendence

Once you reach 17th level, you are close to becoming one with your connection. You learn how to temporarily transcend your physical form. Once after each long rest, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to project your consciousness outside of your physical body in the form of an intangible psychic image of yourself. This counts as a 6th-level illusion effect and lasts for 1 minute. While your consciousness is projected, your physical body is considered blinded, deafened, and paralyzed, but you can return to your body as a bonus action. You control your psychic image as though it was your own body, and your senses perceive only what the image can see and hear. You move with a fly speed of 60 feet. You can pass through solid objects as though you were incorporeal, but you can’t go completely into a solid object. You can’t directly affect physical objects. Your projected consciousness is immune to most attacks or effects, whether or not they affect incorporeal creatures, but mind affecting effects or attacks dealing psychic damage have their full effect on you.

You can cast any mystic spell or spell-like ability with a range of touch or greater from your projected consciousness. The spells affect other targets normally. You can’t cast any spells on your projected consciousness except for illusion spells. You need not maintain line of effect to your projected consciousness, but if you cross into another plane, even momentarily (including via Drift travel), your mind immediately returns to your physical body.

### Improved Intuitive Spells

At 19th level, you can use your [Intuitive Spells](#intuitive-spells) feature to cast each of your connection spells once, not just the 1st and second level ones.

### Enlightenment

You achieve enlightenment, becoming a living incarnation of your connection. You no longer age, nor do you die of old age. Once per day as a bonus action, you can enter a state of total communion with your connection that lasts for 1 minute. During this time, you gain advantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, ability and skill checks, and you gain 20 temporary Resolve Points that you can use only on connection powers. Any unspent temporary Resolve Points disappear at the end of this minute. In addition, once per week, you can cast *miracle* as a spell-like ability.
