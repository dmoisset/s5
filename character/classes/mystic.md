# Mystic

You understand that what most people call magic is simply an expression of the innate connection between all things, and you intuitively tap into this unseen power to create strange effects. You may conceptualize the source of your magic as divine grace, a manipulation of fundamental energy, or an unlocking of psychic potential, but always with the knowledge that you are a conduit channeling forces greater than yourself. Though you may study, you understand that spellcasting—like all existence—is messy and intuitive, and you specialize in biology and mental systems too complex to be perfectly understood by science. You sense the intangible and exploit your bonds with others, whether to bolster them or bend them to your will.

### Spells

Your connection grants you the intuition to produce magical effects.

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the mystic spell list. You learn additional mystic 
cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Mystic table.

#### Spell Slots

The Mystic table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these mystic spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *Cure Wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *Cure Wounds* using either slot.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the mystic spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Mystic table shows when you learn more mystic spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 4th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the mystic spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer mystic list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your mystic spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to link your intuition and your connection. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a mystic spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
