# Technomancer

To the uninitiated, magic and technology are completely unrelated, but you know there are more correlations between the two 
than most suspect. Magic and technology are just tools, and when combined into one discipline, called technomancy, they can 
be far more powerful than one or the other on its own. You utilize tech to empower, harness, and manipulate magic, and you 
wield magic to augment, control, and modify technology. You are an expert at hacking the underlying structure of the 
universe itself, bending the laws of science and nature to your will. Your technomancy—which is gained from scientific study 
and experimentation—manipulates the physical world, weaves illusions, allows you to peer through time and space, and if 
necessary, can blast a foe into atoms.

Star5er does not have wizards, but technomancers are quite similar (both rules-wise as in role).

*   Your spell cache

### Spellcasting

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the technomancer spell list. You learn additional technomancer 
cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Technomancer table.

#### Spell Cache

As the culmination of your early study of the fundamental forces of the galaxy, you have created a spell cache that allows 
you to store and access spells. Your spell cache could be a device such as a handheld computer or technological implant; an 
item such as a ring or staff; or a symbol such as a brand, tattoo, or other permanent modification to your body. You 
don’t need your spell cache to cast your spells.

If your spell cache is damaged, you can repair it as part of the benefits of getting a long rest. If it is destroyed, you 
can rebuild it after a week with an 8 hour long ritual (although the new cache comes empty).

At 1st level, your spell cache contains six 1st-level technomancer spells of your choice. Your spell cache is the repository 
of the technomancer spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.

Your spell cache has a limited capacity of spells equals 4 + 2 × your technomancer level. Each of these spells must be of a 
level you’re able to cast. You can do the following things to manage the content of your cache.

*   __Deleting spells.__ Removing a spell from your cache takes 1 minute. Note that this doesn’t affect your set of learned 
    spells if you have that spell prepared. This leaves empty space for other spells
*   __Copying spells to gems.__ You can craft spell gems (following normal crafting rules and costs) for any spell you have 
    in your cache. Note that you can use this process to backup spells you plan to delete or fear losing. You can also craft 
    gems with spells from other caches you might find, which can later allow you to move those spells into your cache.
*   __Transferring gems to the cache.__ If you have space available in your cache, you can transfer the spell from a spell 
    gem into the cache. This spends the gem and takes 1 hour per spell level.
*   __Writing known spells into the cache.__ If you have a spell prepared but it’s not into your cache (for example, if you 
    deleted it or built a new cache) you can store it again assuming the cache has enough space. This needs building some 
    temporary components to assist the transfer that are expended in the process and cost ⅕ of the cost of a spell gem of 
    the level being transferred. This process takes 10 minutes per spell level
*   __Learning spells when levelling up.__ Each time you gain a technomancer level your spell cache will get two new free 
    slots. You can fill those for free with two technomancer spells of your choice and of any level that you’re able to 
    cast.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Technomancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these 
spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long 
rest.

You prepare the list of technomancer spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells 
from your spell cache equal to your Intelligence modifier + your technomancer level (minimum of one spell). The spells must 
be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 
16, your list of prepared spells can include seven spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spell 
cache. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *magic missile*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting 
the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time 
spent studying your spell cache and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 
minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your technomancer spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study 
and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your 
Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a technomancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with 
one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a technomancer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spell cache. 
You don't need to have the spell prepared.

#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher

Each time you gain a technomancer level, you can add two technomancer spells of your choice to your spell cache for free. 
Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Technomancer table. On your 
adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spell cache.

#### Multiclassing

For multiclassing purposes, count ⅔ of the Technomancer levels+1 for determining the number of spell slots.

### Arcane Recovery

You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spell cache. Once per day when you finish a short 
rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less 
than half your technomancer level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 5th level or higher.

For example, if you're a 4th-level technomancer, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover 
either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

### Arcane Tradition

When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one specific school: the school of technomancy is described below, although others may be available.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 9th, and 14th level and 17th level.

### Cache Recall

When you reach 3rd level you can activate your spell cache to cast any one spell you know of up to 3rd level and are capable of casting without spending a spell slot. After using this ability you can not do it again until you take a long rest.

### Ability Score Improvement :five:

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Cache Capacitor

At 6th level you modify your capacitor to be able to hold some spells for a long period of time. After preparing your spells, you can cast a spell that you have prepared into your cache which will affect you for 24 hours or until you end your next long rest. You do not need to hold concentration for this spell even if the spell usually requires it. The spell must be cast at its lowest possible level.

The capacitor can hold the following spells: *Detect Radiation*, *Disguise Self*, *Keen Senses*, *Unseen Servant*. If the spell casted this way is dispelled or dismissed, you can recast the same one in the same way by concentrating for 5 minutes; this restores the remaining duration.

At 11th level your spell gets another separate slot where you can cast and hold *Darkvision*, *Lesser Resistant Armor*, *Life Bubble* or *Spider Climb*

At 15th level, your spell gets another separate slot where you can cast and hold *Detect Magic*, *Fly*, *Levitate*, *See Invisibility* or *Tongues*.

### Spell Mastery :five:

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level 
technomancer spell and a 2nd-level technomancer spell that are in your spell cache. You can cast those spells at their 
lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, 
you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.

### Signature Spells :five:

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-
level technomancer spells in your spell cache as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't 
count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a 
spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

## School of Technomancy (Arcane Tradition)

### Magic Hack

At 2nd level you learn a Magic Hack. You get an additional magic hack at 6th level, and another at 9th level. You get two additional magic hacks at 14th level and an additional two at 17th level.

Some Magic Hacks affect the attributes of a spell; you can only use one of those per spell cast.

The following Magic Hacks are available:

__Countertech.__ As a reaction, when you take damage from a technological weapon or damage targeting you specifically, you can expend a spell slot to disrupt the attack. The level of the spell slot + 1 must be at least the min proficiency of the disrupted equipment. You choose which level slot to use, and if it is enough to disrupt the weapon, you take half damage.

__Empowered Weapon.__ As a bonus action you can spend a spell slot to enhance the damage of your weapon. Until the start of your next turn, attacks with the selected weapon you’re wielding get a bonus in attack rolls equal to the spell level spent, and you gain a 1d6 bonus on the damage roll (same damage type as the weapon)

__Energize Spell.__ As a bonus action you can use a battery or a power cell of some equipment to power your spells instead of a spell slot. Your battery needs to have 20 charges per level of the spell slot, and must be at hand. You must then cast the spell before the beginning of your next turn or lose the effect (and the charges). Once you’ve done this you can’t do it again until after your next long rest.

__Fabricate Tech.__ As an action, you can spend a spell slot to craft a temporary technological item. The item minimum proficiency must be at most yours, and you need to spell a slot of a level equal to that proficiency. The item must be Medium or smaller and weigh at most 10 bulk. This counts as a cast spell (can be counterspelled, dispelled, etc). The item lasts for 10 minutes and then disappears. You can not use this hack to build armor, weapons, magic items, or anything with limited uses or charges.

__Harmful Spells.__ When you cast an instantaneous spell that does damage, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage roll. This applies to all creatures within an area of effect, but only one damage roll for those spells that allow multiple damage rolls (like magic missile or scorching ray). This doesn’t apply for further damage rolls (for those spells that keep doing damage over time). This doesn’t apply for non-HP damage (for example ability damage).

__Quick Scan.__ As an action, you can have a general idea of what’s inside a drive or storage media. You must pass the hand near the device without needing to touch it or connect to it. You get very general information (like the kind of data from “spells”, “inventory records” or “kitten videos”). If you’re scanning a technological creature, it gets a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect, and you can not try again on the same creature until your next long rest.

__Robot Influence.__ You can affect technological creatures with mind affecting effects even if they would be normally immune to those for its type. They still get a saving throw as the effect allows it, and their type still gives them advantage on that saving throw.

__Selective Targeting.__ This ability works like the Sculpt Spells feature of the School of Evocation. At 6th level, you can spend a resolve point to exclude any number of creatures that you like from the area.

__Spell Countermeasures.__ You have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma saves vs magical effects.

__Technomantic proficiency.__ As an action, you can spend 1 RP to gain proficiency with a specific weapon (like “corona laser rifle”). This doesn’t allow you to ignore the minimum proficiency of a weapon. You can fire the weapon during as many rounds as levels you have. When this happens, or 10 minutes after you used the ability, the effect ends.

At level 6th or higher, the following Magic Hacks become available too:

__Charging Jolt.__ As a bonus action you can recharge batteries and power cells with your spell slots. You must touch the power cell and it gets 10 charges per slot level as long as it can hold the charges. You can also use this to jump-start or short-out an electronic device, by using this after an Engineering check to disable the device. You get a bonus equal to the level of the slot you spent.

__Debug Spell.__ After rolling damage for an instantaneous spell, you can spend 1 RP to reroll one of the dice that rolled a 1. At 10th level, you can reroll 2 dice at the same cost, and at 14th level you can reroll three of them, as long as they rolled a 1.

__Distant Spell.__ By spending 1 RP you gain the benefit of the sorcerer ability with the same name

__Extended Spell.__ By spending 1 RP you gain the benefit of the sorcerer ability with the same name

__Fabricate Arms.__ This works like the Fabricate Tech magic hack but it allows you to create armor or weapons. The item appears in your hand, on your person, or adjacent to you. The size limit for the weapon is anything you can carry two handed. This item persists for 1 minute. You are proficient with the created item. You can not create magic items or items that are expended with use (like arrows or grenades)

__Magic Negation.__ You can use 1 RP to temporarily suppress a magic effect. You can only suppress an effect of a level that you’d be able to cast (although you don’t need to have unspent slots). The effect is not dispelled, just suppressed for 3 rounds. If you target a spell affecting a creature the creature can attempt a Charisma saving throw to prevent the suppression.

__Spell Grenade.__ You can spend 1 RP to store a “touch” ranged spell into a grenade. This takes the usual time to cast that spell (and does not include throwing the grenade, which is usually an action). If you don’t throw the grenade before the end of your next turn, the spell effect is lost (the grenade works as usual). You are considered proficient with the grenade while the spell affects it. The grenade works as usual, when it explodes you can choose a single creature within its blast and it’s affected by the spell.

At 9th level, the following Magic Hacks become available too:

__Diviner’s Tap.__ You hack a computer to provide surveillance. This requires 10 minutes and a successful Int(Computers) check vs the computer base DC (if you fail, you can’t retrying). This tap lasts for a week, or until you set another tap. You can program your tap either to give you general information about user activity on the device or to receive a mental alarm when a user accesses or transmits data about a specific topic (getting an idea of the information found). For instance, a user might hold a video call to talk about your exploits. If you chose to receive general information, you might know that a video call took place but not the call’s topic. If you chose to have the tap receive an alarm when the topic is you, you’d get the gist of the conversation (but not a complete transcript).

__Flash Teleport.__ You can cast misty step by spending 1 RP instead of a spell slot. You are not required to have it prepared or even in your spell cache.

__Mental Mark.__

__Spellshot.__ You can cast an area spell with a casting time of an action or bonus action through a ranged weapon, using the range of the weapon instead. As an action, you can make a single attack and cast the spell at the same time; the point of origin for the area is on the creature and if a direction is needed (for example line or cone effects) you can choose any. Spells that originate on you can not be used with this hack.

__Tech Countermeasures.__ As a bonus action, you can spend 1 RP to make yourself harder to hit. Until the beginning of your next turn you can spend your reaction when being hit with a technological weapon to impose disadvantage on an attack roll made against you (rerolling again and taking the lowest result). If the weapon allows a Dexterity saving throw for half damage, you instead can spend your reaction after a successful save to completely negate the damage.

__Widened Spell.__ When you cast a sphere or burst area spell, you can spend 2 RP to double its radius.

At 14th level, the following Magic Hacks become available too:

__Countertech Sentinel.__ You need to have the Countertech hack to choose this. Once you choose this you can use that hack also on attacks against allies within 15 feet (but not area attacks)

__Eternal Spell.__ Choose one 1st-level spell you know from the list of technomancer spells. You can cast it at will, as though it were a cantrip spell. It still counts as one of your spells known, not one of your cantrips known.

__Phase Shot.__ As an action, spend 1 RP and make a single attack with a ranged weapon to a target you are aware of. The shot ignores any non-magical obstacle or barrier on the way to the target. The attack also ignores cover. Magical barriers such as a wall of force still stop the attack. Protective equipment worn by the target also has its normal effect.

__Quickened Spell.__ You can cast a spell with a casting time of an action as a bonus action. You can spend 1 RP to cast a cantrip, or 2 RP to cast another spell.

__Rain of Fire.__ As an action you can spend 2RP to shoot a ranged weapons at multiple targets within range. The number of targets is half your level or the number of shots left. Each target can be shot only once. Once you use this, you can not use it until your next short rest.

__Reboot Mind.__ As an action you can spend 1RP and touch a willing creature. This finishes all mind affecting conditions (charm effects, fear, compulsion, mind based paralysis). It also removes any conditions that greater restoration would remove imparted by a mind affecting effect. The subject also becomes stunned until the end of its next turn while its mind is rebooted. If an ally would normally accept this effect but is under some mind-affecting effect that makes her unwilling, she must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against the DC of the effect. On a success, her mind is rebooted, otherwise your RP is spent with no effect.

You can use this ability on yourself, and you can do it at the beginning of your turn without taking actions if you’re unable to take actions. You are then stunned after the end of your next turn.

__Seeking Shot.__ As an action, you spend a RP and make a single attack with a ranged weapon within range. The shot travels to the target, even around corners. Only an unavoidable obstacle or the limit of the weapon’s range prevents the shot from reaching the target. This ability negates cover.

__Spell Library.__ Your spell cache gains a capacity of 5 spells. When you get the extra capacity, you can also fill the space with spells of your choice from the class spell list.

### Fuse Spells

At 17th level you can combine spell slots into higher level spell slots. When casting a spell, you can use 1RP to spend several slots together and cast the spell at a slot of the sum of the other slot levels. You can not build slots that are higher level than your maximum slot level in this way.

By spending 2 RP you can fuse a 6th and a 7th level slot to cast Wish as a 9th level spell.
