# Soldier

Conflict is an inevitable result of life. On every world that harbors complex living organisms, creatures battle one
another for dominance, resources, territory, or ideals. Whether you’ve taken up arms to protect others, win glory,
exact revenge, or simply earn a living, you are the perfect embodiment of this truth. You’re an expert at combat
of all types but tend to prefer heavy armor and weapons—the bigger, the better. You may be a career soldier, a fresh
mercenary recruit, or a lone wolf who rejects authority, but whether rushing in for hand-to-hand combat or firing
tactical barrages, you’re a consummate warrior, never hesitating to put yourself in the line of fire to protect
your friends.

### Action Surge :five:

Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.

### Martial Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose Arcane Assailant, Armor Storm, Blitz, Bombard, Champion, Guard, Hit and Run or Sharpshoot, all detailed at the end of the class description.

# Martial Archetypes

Different soldiers choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.

## Arcane Assailant

The arcane assailant supplements its combat effectiveness with magic powers, drawing on traditions of 
warrior-wizards dating back to well before the Gap. This allows you to use magic runes to augment your weapons and call on 
legendary powers, giving you access to arcane options even when you don’t have a magic weapon in your possession.

### Rune of the Eldritch Knight

Starting at 3rd level you can imbue a weapon with a magic sigil. This weapon is considered magic for the effects of damage 
resistance. The process takes 10 minutes (which can be done during a short rest) and you can imbue a single weapon at a 
time. If you do it on a second weapon, the first weapon loses its rune.  You must be able to touch the weapon during the 
imbuing process. The effects of the rune only apply when you use the weapon.

You can not be disarmed from your weapon with the rune. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon 
as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.

### Secret of the Magi

Starting at 7th level, when you imbue your eldritch rune, you can choose to add a single magic effect to your weapon. You 
can change it so it has one of the following properties:
* deals an additional 2d6 of fire, cold or electrical damage (you choose which type when imbuing the weapon).
* deals force damage instead of its usual damage type.
* the weapon is made non-lethal (knocking unconscious but stable any creature that it reduces to 0 hit points)
Once you select one of these options, it can be switched on and off (returning the weapon to its normal damage) as a bonus action.

### Anchoring Arcana

Starting at 7th level, as an action you can make a single attack with your imbued weapon against an enemy. The enemy must be 
in normal range if the weapon is ranged. Even if the weapon would normally affect multiple creatures, it only affects your 
target. If the attack hits you can spend 1 Resolve Point to force the target to attempt a Charisma saving throw (DC=8+your 
proficiency bonus+the skill used to attack with the weapon). If the target fails, its speed is reduced to 0, can not take 
any bonus to speed, and it’s forbidden to voluntarily use any form of teleportation or planar travel. This effect lasts for 
2 rounds. After using this action, the target is immune to this effect until after its next long rest.

### Power of Legend

Starting at 10th level, as a bonus action, you can spend 1 resolve point to remove the frightened or poisoned conditions 
from yourself. Alternatively you can remove 1 level of fatigue or finish the effects of a bleeding, burning or corroding 
weapon.

### Secret of the Archmagi

Starting at 15th level, you can use your rune of the Eldritch Knight in 2 weapons at once. Additionally, you can choose 
alternate damage types for the extra damage option to acid, radiant, necrotic, or sonic damage. 

### Arcane attack

Starting at 18th level, as an action you can spend a Resolve Point and make a single attack with your imbued weapon. This 
attack ignores all cover and concealment (you must be aware of the creature and its location). If using a ranged weapon, 
this attack must be within the normal range. The attack affects a single target (even if done with a weapon that would 
normally affect more targets).

##  Armor Storm

The armor storm fighting style focuses on using armor as a weapon by maximizing the damage of armor-based weapons while 
withstanding enemy fire. You learn to increase the effectiveness of attacks made with your armor and to add equipment 
normally beyond your armor’s capacity.

### Armor mobility
Heavy or powered armor does not give you a penalty on Dex(Stealth) checks. Heavy and power armor that you are wearing weighs 
1 less bulk for the purpose of determining carrying capacity.

### Enhanced Tank

Starting at 7th level you are proficient with powered armor. You can also use one extra armor upgrade than the number 
allowed by your armor. If you add this bonus upgrade to heavy armor, you can select an upgrade listed for powered armors. An 
upgrade placed in this bonus slot has half the credit cost.

### Smash Through

Starting at 10th level, while wearing heavy or powered armor, you have advantage on Strength(Athletics) rolls to shove other 
creatures. If you succeed on the shove, you can also make an attack roll with your unarmed strike (without spending an extra 
attack) and damage your target.

### Mobile Army

Starting at 15th level, you deal an extra 1d6 damage with any attack from a weapon that is part of your armor (including 
unarmed attacks and weapons attached as armor upgrades). The additional damage is the same type as the weapon’s normal type. 
Also, while wearing heavy or powered armor you gain advantage in opposed checks to prevent being grappled or shoved.

### On the Bounce

Starting at 18th level, while wearing heavy or powered armor, if you use the attack action your movement does not provoke 
attacks of opportunity during that turn.

## Blitz

The blitz archetype is all about using speed and aggression to get into the thick of melee. You increase your speed and 
responsiveness, gain abilities that make you better at melee combat than your enemies, and keep on fighting even when 
surrounded by foes.

### Rapid Response

Starting at 3rd level, you gain advantage on initiative rolls and your base speed increases by 10 ft.

### Charge Attack

At 7th level you gain the Charger feat.

### Keep Fighting

Starting at 10th level, as a bonus action, you spend a Resolve Point and gain the benefit of Second Wind, even if you’ve 
already used it. The amount of SP gained by your Second Wind increases by 1d10 at 15th level and another additional 1d10 at 
18th level.

### Perfect Opportunity

At 15th level you gain the Sentinel feat. If you already had it, you gain another feat.

### Against the Odds

At 18th level, you gain a bonus to melee weapon damage rolls equal to twice the number of enemies within 10 feet of you. 
Your GM may decide that some enemies don’t constitute a significant threat and do not count for this.

## Bombard

The bombard soldier emphasizes attacking multiple targets, often using grenades, and leverages substantial physical strength to control large weapons with significant recoil. At higher levels, you can use launchers, missiles, and other heavy weapons.

### Grenade Expert
Starting at 3rd level, you’re able to salvage enough materials to create a grenade without paying for it. Creating a grenade 
takes 10 minutes. You can create any grenade you can be proficient with, but this grenade is unstable and only you can use 
it effectively. If anyone else tries to use the grenade, it is a dud. You can have only one grenade created by this ability 
at one time (if you create a new grenade using this ability, the old grenade no longer works).

### Powerful Explosives

Starting at 7th Level, for weapons with the explode property and a radius of at least 10 ft, you can choose to increase its 
explosion radius by 5 feet.

### Heavy Fire

Starting at 7th Level, as an action you can make a single attack using a ranged weapon and add your Strength modifier to the 
normal damage to all targets. This also works with weapons having the Automatic, Unwieldy or Explode properties.

### Debilitating attack

At 10th level, when you hit with a ranged attack or an attack with a Blast or Explode properties, you can spend 1 Resolve 
Point to attempt to impose a debilitating condition on your target for 4 rounds. You can choose to make the target deafened, 
gain one level of fatigue (up to 1), or reduce its speed to half (to a minimum of 10). The target can negate this effect by 
succeeding at a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 8+proficiency bonus+ability modifier used in the attack roll.

### Explosives Acumen

At 15th level the DC to avoid explosions for your weapons with the explode property increases by 1. You gain advantage to 
Dexterity saving throws to prevent damage from your own explosives.

### Impactful attack

When you reach 18th level, you can make a single ranged attack as an action that pushes enemies back. After resolving the 
attack normally, enemies that you hit are knocked back 10 feet. If you aimed an explosion to a location, targets that failed 
the saving throw are knocked 10 feet away from the center of the explosion. An enemy hit by a critical hit or rolling a 
natural 1 on its saving throw is also knocked prone. This attack can’t be done with an Automatic weapon but it can be done 
with a Blast weapon.

## Champion

The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.

### Improved Critical :five:

Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

### Remarkable Athlete :five:

Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check 
you make that doesn’t already use your proficiency bonus. In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you 
can cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.

### Additional Fighting Style :five:

At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.

### Superior Critical :five:

Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18–20.

### Survivor

At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain stamina 
points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your stamina points left. You don’t gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.

## Guard

The guard martial archetype focuses on defense. You become adept at wearing armor, protecting against attacks, and enduring 
damage and other setbacks from attacks that get through your defenses.

### Armor Training

When you reach 3rd level, the maximum dexterity bonus that can be used for medium armor is +3, and you can add up to +1 of 
your dexterity bonus when using heavy armor.

### Guard’s Protection

Starting at 7th level, when an ally within 5ft is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to intercede. You take half of 
the damage and your ally takes the rest. This has no effect on spell effects that not require an attack roll. Any conditions 
delivered by the attack apply to both of you.

### Armored Parry

Starting at 7th level, if you are wearing medium or heavier armor, you can use your reaction to gain a +2 bonus to your AC 
until the beginning of your next turn.

### Rapid Recovery

Starting at 10th level, as a bonus action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to suppress for 10 minutes one of the following 
conditions: frightened or poisoned. Alternatively you can remove 1 level of fatigue or finish the effects of a bleeding, 
burning or corroding weapon.

### Kinetic Resistance

At 15th level you can spend your reaction when taking either piercing, slashing or bludgeoning damage to halve the damage 
received.

### Impenetrable Defense

When you reach 18th level, you can set up a strong defense for you and an adjacent ally using an action to do so. Until the 
start of your next turn, you gain resistance to piercing, slashing and bludgeoning damage, and both you and your ally gain 
the benefit of a Dodge action. If you use Guard’s Protection while this effect is active, you can choose to direct all the 
damage to yourself so that your ally takes none

## Hit and Run

The hit-and-run soldier focuses on tactical movement as you move in and out of combat. You use ranged weapons but 
fight close up, and you can even mix ranged and melee attacks. Your abilities allow you to avoid getting locked down by your enemies.

### Opening Volley
Starting at 3rd level. If a ranged attack on the first turn of combat hits an opponent, the next melee attack to the same opponent is done with advantage if it happens before the end of your next turn. Starting at 10th level, you can also gain this benefit from a ranged attack in the second round of combat.

### Nimble Fusillade
Starting at 7th level, when using your attack action, you can use a bonus action in the same turn to Dash.

### Duck and Weave

Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to avoid provoking attacks of opportunity from your movement. You can also spend 1 Resolve Point to not get the normal disadvantage when shooting a ranged weapon within 5 feet of a hostile creature.

### Elusive Target

Starting at 15th level, when you move, you are considered to have half cover until the beginning of your next turn.

### Harrying Shot

At 18th level, you can use the Harrying Fire action but the attack deals damage as normal. You can combine this with Nimble Fusillade as if this was an attack action.

## Sharpshoot

The sharpshoot archetype enables you to excel at making accurate attacks, usually with ranged weapons at a long 
distance. You can ignore cover and other impediments to your shots, and your attacks are improved by your intense focus.

### Sniper’s Aim

At 3rd level, you gain the Sharpshooter feat.

### Focus Fire

Starting at 7th level, if your attack action with a ranged weapon directs all of its attacks at a single creature, you get a 
+2 bonus to each attack roll. If that creature kills or knocks out the target you lose the rest of your attacks.

### Intense Focus

Starting at 10th level, as a bonus action you can spend 1 Resolve Point to negate the disadvantage of firing at a target you 
can’t see clearly (but you must know at least the location the creature is in). The benefit applies to all of your attacks 
during your turn.

### Focused Damage

Starting at 15th level, when you use an attack action benefiting from Focus Fire, each individual attack made as part of the 
action deals an extra 2d6 damage.

### Prepared Shot

At 18th level, you can use an action to study a target that you could attack with a range weapon having advantage (for 
example, the target is blinded or paralized, or you are hidden). On the first attack you succeed against that target on your 
next turn, the target is incapacitated until the end of its next turn. If you score a critical hit, the target is stunned 
instead. Once you use this action, you can not use it on the same creature until you get a long rest. If you make any 
attacks between preparing your shot and the beginning of your next turn, you lose the benefit of this action.
