# Soldier

Conflict is an inevitable result of life. On every world that harbors complex living organisms, creatures battle one
another for dominance, resources, territory, or ideals. Whether you’ve taken up arms to protect others, win glory,
exact revenge, or simply earn a living, you are the perfect embodiment of this truth. You’re an expert at combat
of all types but tend to prefer heavy armor and weapons—the bigger, the better. You may be a career soldier, a fresh
mercenary recruit, or a lone wolf who rejects authority, but whether rushing in for hand-to-hand combat or firing
tactical barrages, you’re a consummate warrior, never hesitating to put yourself in the line of fire to protect
your friends.
