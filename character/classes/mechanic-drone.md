# Drones

If you choose the drone option for your artificial intelligence, you begin play with a robotic drone that you design. See Building Your Drone below for instructions on creating your drone.

All drones have the same senses as an ordinary human. A drone is considered a construct with the technological subtype for the purposes of spells and effects targeting it. Your drone speaks all of the languages that you do. Your drone is proficient in your choice of either small arms or basic melee weapons.

Like most constructs, a drone cannot recover from damage on its own. If a drone is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it becomes inactive until it is restored to 1 Hit Point or more. If a drone takes damage from a single attack equal to or greater than its maximum Hit Points while it has 0 current HP, the drone is destroyed.

If your drone is ever destroyed or lost, you retain its mind and all its subroutines in your custom rig and can replace its body for free using your custom rig after 24 hours of uninterrupted work. You can take a single long rest during each 24 hours spent working, but any other interruption greater than a moment of conversation requires you to add 12 hours to the time required to rebuild your drone. In addition, every time you gain a mechanic level, you can rebuild your drone from scratch with the same amount of work, allowing you to change any or all of the choices you made for your drone (including ability scores, chassis and mods).

### Repairing your Drone

Once per day, you can take 10 minutes to repair your drone, which then recovers 10% of its Hit Point maximum. Additionally, any time you take a short rest and recover Stamina Points by spending 1 RP, you can also choose to repair your drone as part of that same time period. This is an exception to the normal rule that you cannot perform any tasks while taking a short rest.

### Building your Drone

Building a drone is a multistep process. First, choose the drone’s chassis, which along with your mechanic level determines its base statistics. Next, choose your drone’s special abilities. Finally, select your drone’s modifications (“mods”), which grant your drone additional abilities and allow you to fully customize it.
Other than those aspects determined by your drone’s chassis and mods, the exact details of your drone’s appearance and personality are up to you.

#### Building your Drone: Chassis

Each drone has one of three chassis types that determines its size, starting statistics, and initial mods, as well as the drone’s overall look and theme. These chassis types are combat, hover, and stealth, and they are presented below. Each is described as an NPC stat sheet, which is actually a base set of stats that will be modified by your customizations. 

The bonuses calculated in the stat blocks are based in the initial stats (and already include a proficiency bonus of +2) and should be adjusted as the ability scores or proficiency bonus of the drone changes. Your drone has a Proficiency Bonus corresponding to your mechanic level that should be added to its proficient saving throw and skills.

The stat block also includes the following elements specific to drones:

**Ability Increases:** These are the drone’s abilities that have their score increased as you gain levels, as described in the Drone Ability Increase feature.

**Initial Mods:** Each chassis comes with initial drone mods that are a part of the chassis itself. These are in addition to the mods a drone gains by level. You can’t change these mods when you gain levels or rebuild your drone unless you choose a new chassis.
