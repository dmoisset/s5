# Drones

If you choose the drone option for your artificial intelligence, you begin play with a robotic drone that you design. See Building Your Drone below for instructions on creating your drone.

All drones have the same senses as an ordinary human. A drone is considered a construct with the technological subtype for the purposes of spells and effects targeting it. Your drone speaks all of the languages that you do. Your drone is proficient in your choice of either small arms or basic melee weapons.

Like most constructs, a drone cannot recover from damage on its own. If a drone is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it becomes inactive until it is restored to 1 Hit Point or more. If a drone takes damage from a single attack equal to or greater than its maximum Hit Points while it has 0 current HP, the drone is destroyed.

If your drone is ever destroyed or lost, you retain its mind and all its subroutines in your custom rig and can replace its body for free using your custom rig after 24 hours of uninterrupted work. You can take a single long rest during each 24 hours spent working, but any other interruption greater than a moment of conversation requires you to add 12 hours to the time required to rebuild your drone. In addition, every time you gain a mechanic level, you can rebuild your drone from scratch with the same amount of work, allowing you to change any or all of the choices you made for your drone (including ability scores, chassis and mods).

## Repairing your Drone

Once per day, you can take 10 minutes to repair your drone, which then recovers 10% of its Hit Point maximum. Additionally, any time you take a short rest and recover Stamina Points by spending 1 RP, you can also choose to repair your drone as part of that same time period. This is an exception to the normal rule that you cannot perform any tasks while taking a short rest.

## Building your Drone

Building a drone is a multistep process. First, choose the drone’s chassis, which along with your mechanic level determines its base statistics. Next, choose your drone’s special abilities. Finally, select your drone’s modifications (“mods”), which grant your drone additional abilities and allow you to fully customize it.
Other than those aspects determined by your drone’s chassis and mods, the exact details of your drone’s appearance and personality are up to you.

### Building your Drone: Chassis

Each drone has one of three chassis types that determines its size, starting statistics, and initial mods, as well as the drone’s overall look and theme. These chassis types are combat, hover, and stealth, and they are presented below. Each is described as an NPC stat sheet, which is actually a base set of stats that will be modified by your customizations. 

The bonuses calculated in the stat blocks are based in the initial stats (and already include a proficiency bonus of +2) and should be adjusted as the ability scores or proficiency bonus of the drone changes. Your drone has a Proficiency Bonus corresponding to your mechanic level that should be added to its proficient saving throw and skills.

The stat block also includes the following elements specific to drones:

**Ability Increases:** These are the drone’s abilities that have their score increased as you gain levels, as described in the Drone Ability Increase feature.

**Initial Mods:** Each chassis comes with initial drone mods that are a part of the chassis itself. These are in addition to the mods a drone gains by level. You can’t change these mods when you gain levels or rebuild your drone unless you choose a new chassis.

### Building your Drone: Base Statistics

The stats of your drone are adjusted according to the drone’s level. The drone level is usually your mechanic level but can be a smaller value if you are using the control net class feature. Adjust the base chassis statistics in the following way:

* **Proficiency Bonus:** Your drone has a Proficiency Bonus corresponding to your mechanic level. This is usually your mechanic level but can be a smaller value if you are using the control net class feature.
* **Hit Points:** A drone always has 5 hit points per level. Drones do not have Stamina Points
* **Mods:** Your drone can get a number of mods equal to half its level, rounded up (this is an exception to the usual round down rule). Mods included in the chassis do not count for this limit. If a drone has more than 5 extra mods (not counting chassis mods) you can choose mods after the 5th from the advanced mod list.

### Building your Drone: Special Abilities

#### Mods

Starting at 1st level, and on every odd level, your drone gains a new basic mod. Each mod can be installed once unless its description says otherwise. Once your drone has 5 basic mods, it can gain an advanced mod instead. If you rebuild your drone, you must also keep 5 basic mods before adding an advanced one. Chassis mods do not count for this feature.

#### Limited AI

Each round on your turn, after you have acted, your drone can either take an attack action or move up to its speed. You must be able to issue simple commands to your drone, but you don’t have to spend actions to issue these commands. To receive these commands, your drone must be able to see or hear you or be within range of your custom rig. If you become unconscious or otherwise unresponsive, or if your drone is ever out of range, your drone cannot take any actions until you are again able to command it or it is once more within range.

#### Master Control

As a bonus action, you can directly control your drone. This allows the drone to move up to its speed and take either an action or a bonus action this turn. By spending both your action and bonus action, your drone can take an action and a bonus action.

Your drone must be able to see or hear you, or be within range of your custom rig, for you to directly control your drone.

#### Skill Unit

Choose one of the following skills: Acrobatics, Athletics, Computers, Engineering, Perception, or Stealth. Your drone can add its proficiency bonus to this skill and use this when not under your direct control. You can change the skill chosen when rebuilding your drone.

Additionally, whenever you are directly controlling your drone, it can use your proficiency bonus in any of these skills if you wish, assuming it has the appropriate tools to do so (a drone without manipulator arms cannot use Engineering to disable a device, for example).

### Building your Drone: Basic Mods

You can choose from the following list of mods when your drone gains a mod. Some of the following have some additional prerequisites that your drone must satisfy before adding the mod.

**Armor Slot:** Your drone gains an armor upgrade slot for an armor upgrade. If you do not already have an armor upgrade to install, you must purchase one separately. You can install the armor upgrade only if your drone has enough open upgrade slots to meet the upgrade’s requirements. You can select this mod up to four times, each time adding an additional slot.    
**Camera:** Your drone has a camera that you can see through using your custom rig as long as your drone is within range. The camera has ordinary sight, and is capable of seeing whatever an ordinary human could see. The camera can also record up to 1 hour of footage, which can be downloaded and viewed using your custom rig.    
**Cargo Rack:** Your drone is outfitted with cargo space. The drone’s Strength score counts as 4 higher for the purpose of how determining much bulk it can carry, but all of this extra bulk must be stored gear and cargo, not mounted weapons, armor mods, or the like. This does not affect the drone’s actual Strength score in any way, merely how much it can carry. Due to its size, a drone might still be unable to carry awkward or unwieldy items.    
**Climbing Claws:** Your drone gains a climb speed equal to half its land speed. This mod can be applied to only combat and stealth drones.    
**Enhanced Armor:** Your drone gains a +2 bonus to its AC.    
**Enhanced Senses:** Your drone gains darkvision to 60 feet, and proficiency in the Perception skill. If your drone has the camera mod, the camera gains these senses as well.    
**Extra Ammo:** One of your drone’s weapon mounts can hold two additional batteries, magazines, or other type of ammunition in addition to its usual weapon and ammunition capacity. Your drone must have the weapon mount mod before selecting this mod. You can select this mod more than once, up to the number of weapon mounts the drone has.    
**Hardened AI:** Your drone’s AI is secured against outside influence. Any attempt to hack your drone is made at disadvantage, and your drone receives advantage to saving throws against spells or effects that attempt to take control of the drone or otherwise dictate its actions.    
**Hydrojets:** Your drone is equipped with miniature marine jet engines, granting it a swim speed equal to half its land speed. This mod can be applied to only combat drones and stealth drones.    
**Jump Jets:** Your drone is equipped with powerful miniature jets. It can use these jets to jump up to 30 feet as part of its movement (either vertically, horizontally, or in any combination that does not exceed 30 feet). If applied to a hover drone, these jets instead allow your drone to increase its fly speed by 30 feet for 1 round. Once used, these jets must cool down for 1 minute before they can be used again.    
**Manipulator Arms:** Your drone is equipped with two robotic arms with simple hands. They can perform most functions that your arms can perform (such as opening doors, typing on a keypad, wielding a weapon, or attempting skill checks that require manual dexterity), but attacks made with them are made at disadvantage.    
**Melee Weapon Arm:** Your drone is equipped with a robotic arm to which you can affix a one-handed melee weapon, allowing your drone to wield that weapon and attack with it. This weapon cannot be disarmed. Wielding a two-handed melee weapon requires two melee weapon arms. If you do not already have a weapon to equip, you must purchase it separately. Swapping out a weapon in a melee weapon arm requires use of your custom rig and 1 hour of work. You can select this mod multiple times, each time adding an additional melee weapon arm to the drone.    
**Resistance:** Your drone gains resistance to an energy type of your choice—acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic—. You can select this mod multiple times. Its effects do not stack; each time you select this mod, it must apply to a different energy type from the list above.    
**Riding Saddle:** Your drone is equipped with a seat and programming to carry a rider as a combat-trained mount. If you ride your drone, it must be at least your size or larger. To carry another rider, the drone must be at least one size larger than the rider. You can direct your drone mount in battle without attempting Survival checks.    
**Skill Subroutine:** Choose another skill from the skill unit list. Your drone gains proficiency in that skill. Your drone also increases its Intelligence score by 2.    
**Smuggler’s Compartment:** Your drone has a secret compartment that can hold a single item of light bulk or smaller. A successful Perception check (DC = 15) is needed to notice or find the compartment.    
**Speed:** Your drone’s land speed increases by 10 feet.    
**Tool Arm:** Select one technological item from the Equipment section of no more than light bulk and an item proficiency no more than your proficiency bonus. Your drone is equipped with a robotic arm with that item attached and the proper programming to use the item, although it cannot use a tool that requires skill checks unless it also is proficient in the relevant skill or if the drone is under your direct control (which then uses your skill bonus).    
**Weapon Mount:** You can affix a small arm or another one-handed ranged weapon on your drone, allowing it to wield that weapon and attack with it. This weapon cannot be disarmed. Mounting a longarm, a heavy weapon, or another two-handed ranged weapon requires two weapon mounts. A weapon mount can hold up to two batteries, two magazines, or two of another type of ammunition for the affixed weapon, provided this ammunition is of light bulk or less. Multiple weapon mounts used to affix a single two-handed weapon count as a single weapon mount for the purpose of how much ammunition it can hold. The drone reloads these batteries or magazines automatically, which takes the usual amount of time for the weapon. Spent batteries or magazines are stored within the drone. You can replace all of a weapon mount’s batteries or magazines as a bonus action. You must purchase separately or already have the weapon and ammunition for use with a weapon mount. You can replace the weapon with any other weapon that meets the criteria for your mount (for example, if you have two weapon mounts, you could replace a longarm with a heavy weapon). Swapping out a weapon in a weapon mount requires use of your custom rig and 1 hour of work.    
You can select this mod multiple times, each time adding an additional weapon mount to the drone.    
**Weapon Proficiency (Simple Melee Weapon):** Your drone gains proficiency with Simple Melee Weapons    
**Weapon Proficiency (Martial Melee Weapon):** [Requires: Simple Melee Weapon proficiency mod] Your drone gains proficiency with Martial Melee Weapons    
**Weapon Proficiency (Simple Ranged Weapon):** Your drone gains proficiency with Simple Ranged Weapons    
**Weapon Proficiency (Longarm):** [Requires: Simple Ranged Weapon proficiency mod] Your drone gains proficiency with Longarms    
**Weapon Proficiency (Heavy Weapon):** [Requires: Longarm proficiency mod] Your drone gains proficiency with Heavy Weapons    
**Weapon Proficiency (Special Weapon):** [Requires: any other weapon proficiency mod] Your drone gains proficiency with one Special Weapons    

### Building your Drone: Advanced Mods

Note that these mods can only be added to drones that already have 5 basic mods (not counting the chassis mods)

**Advanced Skill Subroutine:** [requires: Skill Subroutine mod] Choose any skill. Your drone gains proficiency in that skill. Your drone also increases its Intelligence score by 2.    
**Echolocators:** Your drone gains blindsight 60 ft.    
**Energy Shield:** Your drone gains an energy shield that provides it with a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your mechanic level. This shield remains active until all of its temporary Hit Points are depleted. The drone can replenish the shield’s Hit Points to full while you’re taking a short rest. You can select this mod a second time to double the energy shield’s temporary Hit Points.    
**Excavator:** Your drone gains a burrow speed equal to half its land speed. It can use this speed to move through clay, dirt, earth, and sand. It does not leave a hole behind, nor is its passage marked on the surface.        
**Flight System:** Your drone gains a fly speed equal to half its land speed for up to 10 minutes per day. This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. You can select this mod a second time; in this case, the drone’s fly speed increases to its full land speed, it gains the ability to hover and there is no limit on the amount of time it can fly.    
**Invisibility Field:** [Requires: reactive camouflage mod] As an action, your drone can turn invisible for 10 minutes. If it makes an attack during this time, the invisibility ends. You then need to take a long rest or the drone must spend 2 Resolve Points to use this ability again.    
**Medical Subroutine:** [Requires: manipulator arms mod, drone proficient with Medicine skill] Your drone is equipped with first aid capabilities. If you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, your drone can attempt to administer emergency medical treatment to you, even despite you being unconscious. On subsequent rounds on your turn, your drone takes as many actions as necessary to return to your side (moving its speed on each turn), followed by an action to administer first aid.    
Once it has done so, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to recover a number of Hit Points equal to your mechanic level. Your drone cannot use this mod on anyone but you nor use it if you are dead or have fewer than 2 RP remaining. Once you benefit from this treatment you can’t benefit from it again until you take a long rest.    
**Reactive Camouflage:** Your drone is equipped with a thin coating that can change color to match the drone’s surroundings. Whenever your drone stays stationary for 1 round, it gains a +10 bonus to Stealth checks (this bonus doesn’t stack with the invisibility spell or similar effects). If your drone takes any action, it loses this bonus until it once again spends 1 round remaining still.    
**Reductive Plating:** Your drone gains resistance to either piercing, bludgeoning or slashing damage. You can select this mod repeatedly, each time choosing a different type of damage.    
**Shock Wave:** Whenever your drone is reduced to fewer than 10 HP, it immediately shuts down and unleashes a shock wave of electricity as a reaction (even if it is deactivated or destroyed by the attack). This deals 1d6 electricity damage per level to every creature within 10 feet (except the drone). An affected creature can attempt a Dexterity save to take half damage.
