# Mechanic

You are a master of machines, from advanced supercomputers to simple magnetic engines. Understanding how these devices work gives you insight into the world around you, allowing you to make the most of your gear, circumvent hardened defenses, and even take over remote systems. Your programming skill also gives you the ability to create a powerful ally, in the form of either an implanted artificial intelligence or a robotic drone, which can assist you with a variety of tasks. If there’s a computer or machine that needs to be fixed, bypassed, or destroyed, you’re the first on the scene. Whether you’re a skilled scientist, a starship engineer, or a battlefield technician, you’re no stranger to combat—but you find it much more reasonable to have your AI or drone do the fighting for you.

*   (a) A tactical semi-auto pistol with 30 rounds or (b) an azimuth laser pistol with a 20 charge battery.
*   A second skin armor
*   An essential kit

### Artificial Intelligence

At 1st level, you construct an artificial intelligence (or AI), a sophisticated program of self-motivated code that you can access for help in a variety of endeavors. This AI is the product of your own genius, far more advanced and complicated than any available for sale to consumers (though it falls short of being truly self-aware), and only you know the secrets of its creation and operation. Your AI can take one of two forms: a drone or an exocortex.

You must pick one of these forms upon taking your first level of mechanic, and once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Your choice grants you additional features at 5th, 7th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels.

### Expertise

At 1st level, you become better at the Engineering and Computers skills. You gain proficiency on them if you’re not proficient, and expertise (your proficiency bonus is doubled) if you already are.

### Custom Rig

You have created a customized toolkit you can use to hack systems and items. Your custom rig can be configured to take up an upgrade slot on your armor or can be installed as a cybernetic [augmentation system](../../equipment/augmentations.md#cybernetics) in your brain (though it can be combined with a datajack for the same price as installing a datajack normally), your eyes, or an arm. Alternatively, you can configure it to be a handheld device, meaning that you must retrieve it and hold it to use it effectively. While using this rig, you always count as having the appropriate tool or basic kit for any Intelligence (Computers) or Intelligence (Engineering) skill check you attempt. Some [mechanic tricks](#mechanic-tricks) and drone mods require the use of a custom rig. In addition, you can use your custom rig as a Mk I comm unit. Finally, if you have a drone, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your drone to issue commands to its AI or directly control it at a range of 2,500 feet.

If your custom rig is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any engineering kit, hacking kit, or other technological toolkit, reconfiguring the materials into a new custom rig with 1 hour of work. You can have only one custom rig at a time. If you create a new custom rig, your old one functions as a normal toolkit of whatever type you made it from and can no longer be used with your mechanic tricks.

### Mechanic Tricks

As you gain experience, you learn tricks that allow you to perform wonders of engineering, aid in electronic infiltrations, and optimize gear. While some of these are things you learn, others are small cybernetic enhancements you make to yourself (none of which have a price or count against your augmentation limits). Some tricks require the use of a custom rig or other gear.

You learn your first mechanic trick at 2nd level, and you learn an additional mechanic trick at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter. If a mechanic trick allows an opponent a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Unless otherwise specified, you can’t learn mechanic tricks more than once.

### Overload

As an action, you can cause a short in an electronic device, including most ranged energy weapons, melee weapons with the powered special property, or a single armor upgrade. This makes the device nonfunctional until the beginning of your next turn. Overload doesn’t cause a locked door, safe, or other device to open, but it prevents anyone from opening it for the duration. You must be adjacent to the device to use this ability. If you have a drone, you can instead use this ability on an electronic device adjacent to your drone. If you have an exocortex with the wireless hack ability, you can instead use this ability on any electronic device within range of your exocortex’s wireless hack. If you use overload on an item or armor upgrade in someone’s possession, the owner can attempt a Dexterity saving throw to negate the effect. Overload doesn’t affect androids, cybernetics, drones, powered armor, robots, or creatures with the technological subtype (all of which have shielding against this sort of attack), or items larger than Medium. Once a device has been successfully overloaded, a residual static charge prevents that device from being overloaded again for 1 minute.

### :five: Ability Score Increase

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Remote Hack

When you reach 5th level, you can use your custom rig to attempt Computers and Engineering skill checks at a range of 20 feet. At 7th level and every 2 levels thereafter, this range increases by 10 feet.

A target of this ability (or a creature attending or observing your target) can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Insight) check opposed to the skill check you rolled to determine that you are the origin of this activity.

### Expert Rig

From 7th level on, your custom rig has improved. Whenever you use your custom rig to successfully hack into a computer, you can also disable one countermeasure installed in the system (except firewalls).

In addition, your custom rig can now be used as any engineering or hacking specialty kit of minimum proficiency +3 or lower, and it has the features of a [computer](../../equipment/computers.md) with a tier equal to ¼ of your level with the artificial personality, hardened, or security I upgrade module. It also has an audio/video recorder. You can add extra modules or countermeasures to your custom rig at the normal prices.

You can also use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access your ship’s downloaded data sets and transponder at a range of 5 miles. If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone at the same range.

### Miracle worker

Starting at 7th level, as a bonus action, you can repair damage to a starship’s systems or modify a suit of armor or weapon to function more efficiently.

To use this ability, you must be able to handle the item affected without impediment. Once you use this ability, you can not use it until you take a long rest. At higher levels you gain additional uses of this ability. The exact effect of this ability depends on the object or system you are modifying.

* Armor: You grant a +2 bonus to the AC of a suit of armor for 1 minute.
* Weapon: You grant a +2 bonus to a weapon’s attack and damage rolls for 1 minute. This bonus does not stack with other effects giving a flat bonus (for example, a +1 enchantment)
* Damaged Ship: You restore a number of Hull Points equal to the starship's base frame HP increment. If this raises the ship’s HP over a multiple of its Critical Threshold, you can repair critical damage to one system per multiple, reducing its severity by one step. For example, if your starship’s Critical Threshold is 8 and you restore 10 HP, reducing the damage to the hull from 17 HP to 7 HP, you could restore one system from wrecked to glitching. Using this ability during starship combat is your action for the turn, and you can do it only during the engineering phase. See the Starship chapter for details on ship repair.

### Override

Your overload class feature now affects androids, drones, robots, and creatures with the technological subtype, which must succeed at an Intelligence saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn. If the target fails its saving throw by 10 or more, it is considered charmed and you can dictate its actions for its next turn, though these actions can’t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack until your next long rest.

### Advanced Rig

Your custom rig’s computer functions gain a bonus [firewall countermeasure](../../equipment/computers.md#countermeasures). This firewall has no additional cost, does not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have, and can block off a module or group of modules already protected by a firewall.

In addition, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access the ship’s sensors, control its security systems, and prepare its engines for takeoff (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert rig) at a range of 50 miles. If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range.

### Control Net

You are capable of operating multiple AIs, one in a drone and one in an exocortex. You must divide up your mechanic level between these different AIs, and each gains abilities based on the number of levels you assign to it. Every time you gain a level in the mechanic class, you can change the distribution of levels between these AIs using your custom rig after 24 hours of uninterrupted work. While each AI can act independently to the limits of its ability, you can control them as normal (although you can directly control only one AI at a time).

The Combat Tracking bonus from your exocortex is only gained if you put at least 5 levels in the exocortex.

### Ghost in the Machine

When using your override class feature to affect an android, drone, robot, or creature with the technological subtype, a target that fails its saving throw by any amount is not incapacitated, and you can instead dictate its actions for its next round. These actions can’t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack until you take a long rest or you spend 1 Resolve Point. You can continue to spend Resolve Points in this manner each round to make the creature susceptible to override again.

### Superior Rig

Your custom rig’s computer functions now gain bonus lockout and wipe countermeasures. You can use your custom rig normally even when its lockout is active (you have special authorization no one else can access under any circumstances), and while any wiped data cannot be recovered by anyone else (as if the data module were destroyed), you can automatically recover it with 8 hours of work. These countermeasures have no additional cost and do not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have.

Additionally, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship at a range encompassing a planet and its close orbit, allowing you to remotely pilot your starship from point to point on the same planet or to and from orbit (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert and advanced rig at the same range). If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range.

### Tech Master

You are a master of technology. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to craft any technological weapon, armor, or item at a rate of 3 minutes per min proficiency bonus or spend 1 Resolve Point to convert any existing technological armor or weapon into another suit of armor or another weapon of equal or lesser value at a rate of 3 minutes per min proficiency bonus. This uses the normal crafting rules, but the item being converted counts as its full value in crafting components. You cannot convert a one-handed weapon into a two-handed weapon. When converting an item into a cheaper item, any excess value is lost and cannot be reclaimed by converting the item back.
