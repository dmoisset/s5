# Mechanic

You are a master of machines, from advanced supercomputers to simple magnetic engines. Understanding how these devices work gives you insight into the world around you, allowing you to make the most of your gear, circumvent hardened defenses, and even take over remote systems. Your programming skill also gives you the ability to create a powerful ally, in the form of either an implanted artificial intelligence or a robotic drone, which can assist you with a variety of tasks. If there’s a computer or machine that needs to be fixed, bypassed, or destroyed, you’re the first on the scene. Whether you’re a skilled scientist, a starship engineer, or a battlefield technician, you’re no stranger to combat—but you find it much more reasonable to have your AI or drone do the fighting for you.

*   (a) A tactical semi-auto pistol with 30 rounds or (b) an azimuth laser pistol with a 20 charge battery.
*   A second skin armor
*   An essential kit

### Artificial Intelligence

At 1st level, you construct an artificial intelligence (or AI), a sophisticated program of self-motivated code that you can access for help in a variety of endeavors. This AI is the product of your own genius, far more advanced and complicated than any available for sale to consumers (though it falls short of being truly self-aware), and only you know the secrets of its creation and operation. Your AI can take one of two forms: a drone or an exocortex.

You must pick one of these forms upon taking your first level of mechanic, and once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Your choice grants you additional features at 5th, 7th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels.

### Expertise

At 1st level, you become better at the Engineering and Computers skills. You gain proficiency on them if you’re not proficient, and expertise (your proficiency bonus is doubled) if you already are.

### Custom Rig

You have created a customized toolkit you can use to hack systems and items. Your custom rig can be configured to take up an upgrade slot on your armor or can be installed as a cybernetic [augmentation system](../../equipment/augmentations.md#cybernetics) in your brain (though it can be combined with a datajack for the same price as installing a datajack normally), your eyes, or an arm. Alternatively, you can configure it to be a handheld device, meaning that you must retrieve it and hold it to use it effectively. While using this rig, you always count as having the appropriate tool or basic kit for any Intelligence (Computers) or Intelligence (Engineering) skill check you attempt. Some [mechanic tricks](#mechanic-tricks) and drone mods require the use of a custom rig. In addition, you can use your custom rig as a Mk I comm unit. Finally, if you have a drone, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your drone to issue commands to its AI or directly control it at a range of 2,500 feet.

If your custom rig is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any engineering kit, hacking kit, or other technological toolkit, reconfiguring the materials into a new custom rig with 1 hour of work. You can have only one custom rig at a time. If you create a new custom rig, your old one functions as a normal toolkit of whatever type you made it from and can no longer be used with your mechanic tricks.

### Mechanic Tricks

As you gain experience, you learn tricks that allow you to perform wonders of engineering, aid in electronic infiltrations, and optimize gear. While some of these are things you learn, others are small cybernetic enhancements you make to yourself (none of which have a price or count against your augmentation limits). Some tricks require the use of a custom rig or other gear.

You learn your first mechanic trick at 2nd level, and you learn an additional mechanic trick at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter. If a mechanic trick allows an opponent a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Unless otherwise specified, you can’t learn mechanic tricks more than once.

### Overload

As an action, you can cause a short in an electronic device, including most ranged energy weapons, melee weapons with the powered special property, or a single armor upgrade. This makes the device nonfunctional until the beginning of your next turn. Overload doesn’t cause a locked door, safe, or other device to open, but it prevents anyone from opening it for the duration. You must be adjacent to the device to use this ability. If you have a drone, you can instead use this ability on an electronic device adjacent to your drone. If you have an exocortex with the wireless hack ability, you can instead use this ability on any electronic device within range of your exocortex’s wireless hack. If you use overload on an item or armor upgrade in someone’s possession, the owner can attempt a Dexterity saving throw to negate the effect. Overload doesn’t affect androids, cybernetics, drones, powered armor, robots, or creatures with the technological subtype (all of which have shielding against this sort of attack), or items larger than Medium. Once a device has been successfully overloaded, a residual static charge prevents that device from being overloaded again for 1 minute.

### :five: Ability Score Increase

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Remote Hack

When you reach 5th level, you can use your custom rig to attempt Computers and Engineering skill checks at a range of 20 feet. At 7th level and every 2 levels thereafter, this range increases by 10 feet.

A target of this ability (or a creature attending or observing your target) can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Insight) check opposed to the skill check you rolled to determine that you are the origin of this activity.

### Expert Rig

From 7th level on, your custom rig has improved. Whenever you use your custom rig to successfully hack into a computer, you can also disable one countermeasure installed in the system (except firewalls).

In addition, your custom rig can now be used as any engineering or hacking specialty kit of minimum proficiency +3 or lower, and it has the features of a [computer](../../equipment/computers.md) with a tier equal to ¼ of your level with the artificial personality, hardened, or security I upgrade module. It also has an audio/video recorder. You can add extra modules or countermeasures to your custom rig at the normal prices.

You can also use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access your ship’s downloaded data sets and transponder at a range of 5 miles. If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone at the same range.

### Miracle worker

Starting at 7th level, as a bonus action, you can repair damage to a starship’s systems or modify a suit of armor or weapon to function more efficiently.

To use this ability, you must be able to handle the item affected without impediment. Once you use this ability, you can not use it until you take a long rest. At higher levels you gain additional uses of this ability. The exact effect of this ability depends on the object or system you are modifying.

* Armor: You grant a +2 bonus to the AC of a suit of armor for 1 minute.
* Weapon: You grant a +2 bonus to a weapon’s attack and damage rolls for 1 minute. This bonus does not stack with other effects giving a flat bonus (for example, a +1 enchantment)
* Damaged Ship: You restore a number of Hull Points equal to the starship's base frame HP increment. If this raises the ship’s HP over a multiple of its Critical Threshold, you can repair critical damage to one system per multiple, reducing its severity by one step. For example, if your starship’s Critical Threshold is 8 and you restore 10 HP, reducing the damage to the hull from 17 HP to 7 HP, you could restore one system from wrecked to glitching. Using this ability during starship combat is your action for the turn, and you can do it only during the engineering phase. See the Starship chapter for details on ship repair.

### Override

Your overload class feature now affects androids, drones, robots, and creatures with the technological subtype, which must succeed at an Intelligence saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn. If the target fails its saving throw by 10 or more, it is considered charmed and you can dictate its actions for its next turn, though these actions can’t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack until your next long rest.

### Advanced Rig

Your custom rig’s computer functions gain a bonus [firewall countermeasure](../../equipment/computers.md#countermeasures). This firewall has no additional cost, does not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have, and can block off a module or group of modules already protected by a firewall.

In addition, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship, allowing you to access the ship’s sensors, control its security systems, and prepare its engines for takeoff (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert rig) at a range of 50 miles. If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range.

### Control Net

You are capable of operating multiple AIs, one in a drone and one in an exocortex. You must divide up your mechanic level between these different AIs, and each gains abilities based on the number of levels you assign to it. Every time you gain a level in the mechanic class, you can change the distribution of levels between these AIs using your custom rig after 24 hours of uninterrupted work. While each AI can act independently to the limits of its ability, you can control them as normal (although you can directly control only one AI at a time).

The Combat Tracking bonus from your exocortex is only gained if you put at least 5 levels in the exocortex.

### Ghost in the Machine

When using your override class feature to affect an android, drone, robot, or creature with the technological subtype, a target that fails its saving throw by any amount is not incapacitated, and you can instead dictate its actions for its next round. These actions can’t be obviously self-destructive. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this attack (regardless of the result), it is immune to this attack until you take a long rest or you spend 1 Resolve Point. You can continue to spend Resolve Points in this manner each round to make the creature susceptible to override again.

### Superior Rig

Your custom rig’s computer functions now gain bonus lockout and wipe countermeasures. You can use your custom rig normally even when its lockout is active (you have special authorization no one else can access under any circumstances), and while any wiped data cannot be recovered by anyone else (as if the data module were destroyed), you can automatically recover it with 8 hours of work. These countermeasures have no additional cost and do not count against the maximum number of countermeasures your custom rig can have.

Additionally, you can use your custom rig to communicate over an encrypted channel with your ship at a range encompassing a planet and its close orbit, allowing you to remotely pilot your starship from point to point on the same planet or to and from orbit (as well as use the encrypted communications functions of your expert and advanced rig at the same range). If you have a drone, you can issue commands to or directly control your drone over an encrypted channel at the same range.

### Tech Master

You are a master of technology. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to craft any technological weapon, armor, or item at a rate of 3 minutes per min proficiency bonus or spend 1 Resolve Point to convert any existing technological armor or weapon into another suit of armor or another weapon of equal or lesser value at a rate of 3 minutes per min proficiency bonus. This uses the normal crafting rules, but the item being converted counts as its full value in crafting components. You cannot convert a one-handed weapon into a two-handed weapon. When converting an item into a cheaper item, any excess value is lost and cannot be reclaimed by converting the item back.

## Mechanic Tricks

You get a mechanic trick at every even level. All tricks have a minimum level number (included next to the name). Some tricks may have other prerequisites, which are described with the trick

### Distracting Hack (2)
You can hack a computer within 30 feet of a foe to distract that foe, such as with a sudden noise or an image. You must be able to access the computer (whether it is your own computer or you are within range to access one manually or via remote hack). The target must succeed an Intelligence saving throw to prevent the effect; otherwise the next attack against that target before the start of your next turn has advantage.

### Energy Shield (2)
As an action, you can use your custom rig to activate an energy shield around yourself. This shield provides you with a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your Intelligence modifier plus your mechanic level. The shield remains active for 10 minutes or until all of its temporary Hit Points are depleted, whichever comes first.
Once used, you cannot use this ability again until you take a short rest; your shield automatically shuts off during this period of rest.

### Hack Directory (2)

Whenever you attempt to hack a system and fail the check, you immediately become aware of any countermeasures that were activated due to your failure. You can then select one of these countermeasures and attempt another Computers check (with the same DC as the original). If you succeed at this second check, you can prevent that countermeasure from activating, as if you had not attempted to access the system at all. Any other countermeasures have their normal effect.

### Neural Shunt (2)
_[Requires: exocortex AI]_ As a reaction when you fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, you can shunt that effect into your exocortex instead. When you do so, you are not affected by the mind-affecting effect, but for the normal duration of that effect, you lose the Expertise granted by your exocortex’s memory module and cannot use any of the exocortex’s abilities in any way (including any proficiencies and mods it grants you). When a mind-affecting effect is shunted into the exocortex, spells such as dispel magic or dispel evil and good can be cast on you to end the effect as if you were affected by it. Once the duration of the mind-affecting effect has ended, your exocortex resumes its normal functions. Once you use this ability, you can not do it again until you take a long rest.

### Nightvision Processor (2)
_[Requires: Visual Data Processor trick]_ Your visual processor is configured to see in the dark. You gain darkvision up to 60 ft.

### Overcharge (2)
As an action you can use your custom rig to overcharge and make a single attack with a ranged energy weapon or a melee weapon with the powered property. If you hit, you deal 1d6 additional damage of the same type the weapon normally deals. This attack uses three times as many charges from the battery or power cell as normal and can’t be used if the weapon doesn’t have enough charges. This trick has no effect on a weapon without a battery or power cell. You can instead use this ability as a bonus action on a touched  powered weapon that is unattended or attended by an ally to grant the same effect to that weapon’s next attack before the beginning of your next turn.
The overcharge damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th (3d6) and 17th(4d6)

### Overclocking (2)
You have augmented the performance of your AI for maximum response timing. You become proficient at initiative checks, and either you (if you have an exocortex) or your drone gains advantage to Dexterity saves.

### Overload Weapon (2)
As an action (or as a bonus action by spending 1 Resolve Point), you can cause a powered weapon (either a ranged energy weapon or a melee weapon with the powered special property) in your possession to explode. You can use the weapon as if it were a grenade of at most the same minimum proficiency of the weapon, dealing the weapon’s normal damage type, except the weapon has a range of only 10/40 feet unless it is a thrown weapon. If someone tries to attack with the weapon, it explodes as a grenade would instead, centered on the user, and the user doesn’t receive a Dexterity save to negate the grenade’s effect (if any). Once you’ve primed a weapon to explode in this way, it’s difficult to reverse the effect, requiring 8 hours of work and a successful opposed Engineering check against you; failing the check by 5 or more detonates the weapon. Once detonated, the weapon is destroyed, just like a grenade.

### Portable Power (2)
You can use your custom rig to supply limited power for up to 1 minute to a computer or starship system that lacks power. If this system is part of a much larger network, this trick does not supply power to the entire network, just to a limited point of access (typically a terminal), which might greatly limit functionality. Once you have used portable power on a system, you cannot do so again on that system until you take a long rest.

### Quick Patch (2)
When you attempt to patch a system on a starship, you reduce the number of actions required to do so by one. This does not reduce the time needed to patch a glitching system, but you can patch two systems with one action.

### Quick repair (2)
When you attempt to repair an item, you can do so in half the time normally required (to a minimum of an action).

### Repair Drone (2)
_[Requires: Drone AI]_ When you spend 10 minutes to repair your drone, you repair 25% of its maximum Hit Points instead of 10%. 

### Visual Data Processor (2)
You notice even the smallest shifts in movement, temperature, and vibration, gaining proficiency with the Perception skill.

### Boost Shield(8)
_[Requires: Energy Shield trick]_ Your energy shield grants you a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your Intelligence modifier + double your mechanic level. In addition, if you have already used your shield, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use it again without needing to take a rest. This replenishes your shield’s temporary Hit Points to full.

### Drone Meld (8)
_[Requires: drone AI]_ As an action while in contact with your drone, you can reconfigure it into a mechanical drone suit (or a backpack-like apparatus, for the Tiny hover drone) that you can wear. While in this form, the drone can’t take any actions or use any of its abilities, but you gain either the drone’s flight system mods if you have a hover drone, reactive camouflage (and an invisibility field if your drone has it) if you have a stealth drone, or reductive plating if you have a combat drone. You can end the meld and return the drone to its normal form as an action. Though it normally acts on your turn just after you, the drone can take no actions on that turn other than transforming back

### Engineer’s Eye (8)
When you are within 10 feet of a trapped or malfunctioning machine or computer, you receive a free Computers, Engineering, or Perception check (as decided by the GM) to notice the trap or defect, whether or not you are actively looking. In addition, due to your intimate knowledge of your ship, you receive one of these checks whenever you board your ship to notice if anything is wrong with the ship’s systems.

### Ghost Intrusion (8)
Whenever you use the Computers skill to access a system and you fail to overcome its defenses by 4 or less, you do not trigger any countermeasures and there is no log of your attempt. If you fail by 5 or more, any countermeasures take effect against you as normal.

### Holographic Projector (8)
Your custom rig can project holographic images as an action as often as you like. This works like casting Major Image, except that it can create visual and sound effects only (not smell or heat). Keeping the projection up requires holding your concentration. This is not a magical effect (so it can not be counterspelled or dispelled)

### Hyperclocking (8)
_[Requires: overclocking trick]_ If you have a drone, it gains Evasion (as the monk or rogue abilities). If you have an exocortex, when you fail a Dexterity saving throw, you can spend 1 RP to reroll the saving throw. This reroll can be done only once per saving throw, and is not subject to the advantage granted by Overclocking.

### Invisibility Bypass Processor (8)
_[Requires: Visual Data Processor trick]_ Your visual data processor allows you to see invisible creatures and objects.

### Resistant Energy (8)
_[Requires: Energy Shield trick]_ Even when your energy shield is inactive, the ambient energy protects you from a particular type of energy attack. Choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You gain resistance against damage of that energy type.

### Scoutbot (8)
You’re always crafting rudimentary bots in your spare time, and can use them to scout. It takes you 10 minutes and 1 Resolve Point to create a scoutbot. A scoutbot is a Small technological construct, its AC is 10, and it has 1 Hit Point per mechanic level you have (and no Stamina Points). It has a land speed of 30 feet, and you can control its movements with your custom rig as a bonus action. It has a camera that streams visual and auditory data back to your rig. The scoutbot ability scores are all 10 (having a +0 bonus to every skill and saving throw), though you can use your own Perception skill when examining the feed from its stream.

Once created, the scoutbot lasts for 10 minutes before falling apart unless otherwise destroyed.

### Extra Mod (8)
If you have a drone, your drone gains an additional basic mod. If you have an exocortex, you gain an additional basic mod. This doesn’t count towards the 5 basic mods required to gain advanced mods. If you rebuild mods, you must keep this as a basic mod.

### Improved Resistant Energy(14)
_[Requires: Resistant Energy trick]_ Choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic (but not the same you chose for Resistant Energy). You also gain resistance against damage of that energy type.

### Invisibility-Hampering Projector (14)
_[Requires: holographic projector trick, invisibility bypass processor trick]_ As a bonus action, you can use your custom rig’s holographic projector to project a holographic image in a direct overlay over an invisible creature within 120 feet, and your custom rig’s computer moves the image to follow the invisible creature, effectively negating the creature’s invisibility as long as it remains within 120 feet of you. If it moves beyond that range, it breaks the effect until you use this ability again.

### Mod Tinkerer (14)
You can spend 24 hours of uninterrupted work to exchange all your drone or exocortex mods at any time, even if you haven’t gained a level. Any other drone features (such as its chassis) can still be exchanged only when you gain a level.

### Saboteur (14)
You have advantage to uses of Engineering to sabotage or disable devices. In addition, if you have the appropriate tools (including your custom rig), performing these tasks takes half the normal amount of time, to a minimum of 1 action.

### Ultraclocking (14)
_[Requires: hyperclocking trick]_ If you have a drone, you can grant the effects of *haste* to your drone for 1 minute as a bonus action. If you have an exocortex, you can gain the effects of *haste* for 1 minute as a bonus action. Once you or your drone has used this ability, you cannot use it again until you get a short rest.

The target of the effect must hold concentration to keep the effect going. This is not a magical effect (so it can not be counterspelled or dispelled)

## AI: Drone

If you choose the drone option for your artificial intelligence at your 1st level of Mechanic, you begin play with a robotic drone that you design. See the [Drone rules](mechanic-drone.md) for instructions on creating your drone.

### Drone Ability Increase

At 5th, 10th, 15th and 20th level, two of your drone ability scores increase. The specific abilities are specified in the chassis and can not be changed. Each ability score increases by +2 points if its currently below 18, or by 1 point if it is 18 or above (even if it is above 20).

### Extra Attack

At 7th level, by spending your action, your drone is able to attack twice instead of once when taking the Attack action.
Your drone’s AI is able to make the additional attack through Limited AI, but both attack rolls are made at disadvantage. Like Limited AI, you must still be conscious and within range.

### Upgraded Power Core

At 10th Level your drone gains a pool of Resolve Points equal to 1 for every 2 levels it has (minimum 1).

### Expert AI

At 10th Level your drone’s AI has grown more sophisticated, giving it a more robust combat routine when not under your direct control. By spending 1 Resolve Point, it can use the Extra Attack ability without getting disadvantage. You can also get the extra attack by spending only a bonus action.

Your drone also gains the ability of using a reaction to take an Attack of Opportunity at disadvantage, or to take a readied action that you set up with Master Control.

### True AI

At 20th level your drone’s AI is completely autonomous. Each round on your turn, your drone gets a full set of actions (Action, bonus action, reaction, move up to its speed) without requiring direct control. You don’t need to issue a command to your drone for it to take actions. You must still control the drone for it to use your skill proficiency.

## AI: Exocortex

You begin play with an exocortex, an artificial processor that interacts with and augments your biological brain’s cognitive functions, which can aid you in a variety of tasks, from combat to digital infiltration. Your exocortex is implanted within your physical body or brain, similar to a piece of cybernetic hardware, allowing your AI to access your mind and feed you information. As you gain levels, your exocortex advances in sophistication and processing power. Only you can access or interact with your exocortex.

You gain the following abilities as you gain levels:

### Combat Tracking

Starting at 1st level, your exocortex provides you with enhanced combat ability, granting you proficiency with medium and heavy armor and longarms. As a bonus action during combat you can designate a foe for your exocortex to track. As long as that target is in sight, the exocortex feeds you telemetry, vulnerabilities, and combat tactics, allowing you to make attack rolls against that target with a +2 bonus. Designating another target causes you to immediately lose this bonus against the previous target.

### Memory Module

Starting at 1st level, you can use your exocortex’s memory module to enhance your own knowledge. Once, as a reaction while not in combat, you can reroll a failed skill check to recall knowledge. In addition, you get expertise (i.e, getting double your proficiency modifier) in a skill you are already proficient with. You can’t use your exocortex’s memory module while combat tracking is activated. Every time you gain a mechanic level, you can rebuild your exocortex’s memory module, replacing the exocortex’s expertise skill by a different skill. You regain the use of this skill after a long rest

### Autonomous Hack

Starting at 5th level, instead of combat tracking, your exocortex can access another computer system within 20 feet, allowing it to attempt a Computers check against that computer each round, using your skill bonus. This is a free action, but counts as a single action for the purpose of the Computers skill (in case you need certain amount of actions to achieve something). You must remain within 20 feet of the computer system for the entire time your exocortex is interacting with the computer. If the task requires multiple actions (or even rounds) to accomplish, you can spend your actions to work in concert with your exocortex, counting both your action and the exocortex’s effective action toward the total time required.

### Exocortex Mods
At 7th level, your exocortex allows you to apply any one of the following drone mods to yourself as if you were a drone with that mod installed: armor slot, cargo rack, climbing claws, enhanced senses, hydrojets, jump jets, resistance, smuggler’s compartment, speed, or weapon proficiency (gaining proficiency in advanced melee or heavy weapons). At 11th level, you can apply an additional mod, and your options expand to include echolocators, excavator, flight system, greater resistance, invisibility field, and reactive camouflage. At 14th and 17th levels, you can apply an additional mod. Each time you gain a level, you can switch any of your mods for different mods, but you must always choose at least one mod from the 7th-level list.

### Twin Tracking
Starting at 10th level, you can designate two targets for your exocortex to track, increasing your attack bonus against each. You can designate both targets with a single bonus, but you must be able to see them both at that time.

### Multitasking
Starting at 15th level you can designate three targets for your exocortex to track (and designate them all as a single bonus action). In addition, the range of your exocortex’s wireless hack increases to 40 feet. Your exocortex can also engage in combat tracking and hack a nearby computer at the same time, but the computer counts as one of the exocortex’s designated targets (allowing you to track only two targets at the same time while wirelessly hacking the computer). Lastly, you can access your exocortex’s memory module in combat, even while it is engaged in combat tracking.

### Quad Tracking

When you reach 20th level, your exocortex can track four targets simultaneously, and hacking a nearby computer doesn’t count against that limit.
