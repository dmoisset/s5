# Backgrounds

Every story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the galaxy. It gives a focus for your character, which may be a result of your upbringing, training, or mystic destiny. Your soldier might have been an outlaw or a bounty hunter. Your technomancer could have been a scholar or a spacefarer. Your operative might have gotten by as an ace pilot or commanded audiences as an icon.

The sample backgrounds in this section provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.

## Ace Pilot

You are most comfortable at the controls of a vehicle, whether it’s a starship racing through the inky void of space or a ground vehicle zooming between trees, around boulders, and across dusty badlands. You might be a member of an elite military force, the recipient of intense courses of training. Alternatively, you might be a total amateur with innate skills that make you a much-admired hotshot.

## Bounty Hunter

You track people down for money. It is a dangerous profession, as most of your targets understandably don’t wish to be caught. You wouldn’t have it any other way. You might have a code of ethics, never taking jobs that, say, target children or members of your own race. You might hunt down only escaped criminals.

## Icon

Thanks to interstellar transmissions and Drift travel, the galaxy is smaller than ever, and this connectivity has facilitated your ascension to celebrity status. You might be a famous performer or a celebrated scientist, but either way, you get recognized on the Pact Worlds and in associated systems.
