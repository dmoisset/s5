## What is Star5er?

Do you play Dungeons & Dragons? Would you like to play a similar games with futuristic technology, faster-than-light starships and bold crews, mixed up in a fantastic world of mystical priests, magical monsters, and space orc pirates wielding holy plasma rifles? Then this is for you.

Star5er is a homebrew tabletop roleplaying game, heavily based on the 5th edition of the world most popular role-playing game, published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc. If you're familiar with that game, it should be really easy to start playing this game. It introduces some changes and new rules to be able to play in a futuristic sci-fi/space setting. The sci-fi content is itself heavily based (without any intention to hide it) on the Starfinder Roleplaying Game, published by Paizo Publishing, LLC.

## What do you need to play?

This is not a standalone game. You will need to know the rules of D&D to play this; those rules are [freely available online](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd), or included with other goodies in published books. 

You don't need any previous knowledge about the Starfinder Roleplaying Game, but if you want to know more about the races, classes, setting, etc, you'll definitely find the published Starfinder material useful.
