# :five: Snuff Life
_6th-level necromancy_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.    
A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a zombie that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability.
