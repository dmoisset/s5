# Detect Tech
_1st-level divination_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Self    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You detect all technological or hybrid items with charges or that replenish charges within 60 ft. That includes batteries, power cells and generators, as well as such items in creatures that you can see (even if the items are hidden on the creature). This detection does not cover items you can’t see or technological traps. 

The detection tells you if it’s an item holding charges or replenishing charges, but nothing else (not even how many charges the item has or can hold)

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, 3 feet of wood or dirt or any force field.
