# Irradiate

_3rd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Duration:** instantaneous

This spell floods the area of effect with dangerous low-level radiation. The central irradiated area is always a 10-foot-radius spread that expands normally per the [rules for radiation areas of effect](/s5/rules/environment.html#radiation). Creatures within the area are exposed to the radiation only once; the radiation does not linger in the area. The saving throw to resist the radiation effects is set by your spell save DC rather than the standard save DC for radiation.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radiation level increases 1 step for each slot level above 3rd.
