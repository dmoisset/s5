# Make Whole
_2nd-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes
**Range:** 30ft.    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

You repair an object up to 4 bulk or a construct creature that you can see, making it gain 5d6 hit points. If the object damage made it non-functional, it recovers its functionality. All the pieces of the object must be present for this spell to function.

This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, and it can restore to such an object if it was lost if your technomancer level is at least twice the level required to create the item.

This spell bypasses any magic immunity in constructs.

**At Higher Levels:**  When you cast this spell using a slot of 3rd level or higher, the bulk limit increases by 1 and the damage fixed increases by 1d6 per each level of the slot above 2nd.
