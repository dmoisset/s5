# Hurl Forcedisk 
_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 120 feet    
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a spinning disk made of pure, shimmering force and hurl it at one opponent that you can see within range, potentially striking other nearby enemies as the disk ricochets. Choose the initial target, and make a ranged spell attack.. If the attack hits, the disk deals 2d8 force damage. The disk then ricochets to hit up to four more creatures of your choice, each no more than 15 feet from the last target. Make a ranged spell attack against each successive target in turn; the disk deals 2d6 force damage to each secondary target struck (this damage is rolled separately for each target). The disk continues to ricochet in this way until it misses, or until it strikes five creatures, or until there are no more valid targets, or until you voluntarily end the spell. A creature can take damage only once from a single casting of this spell.

The exact shape and appearance of the forcedisk is superficially changeable; this does not affect the spell in any other way.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage dealt increases by 1d8 for the initial target and by 1d6 for secondary targets.
