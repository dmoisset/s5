# Logic Bomb 
_2nd-level abjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action   
**Range:** Touch   
**Duration:** 24 hs 

You protect a computer system that you touch against attempts to access it.

If any creature tries to access, destroy or manipulate the computer system or module, the creature takes 5d8 damage (fire, cold, or electricity, your choice at the time of casting). If the creature succeds a Constitution saving throw the damage is halved. If the computer had any other countermeasures they still work as normal

**At Higher Levels:**  When you cast this spell using a slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage dealt increases by 1d8 per each level of the slot above 2nd.
