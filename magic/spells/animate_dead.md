# Animate Dead

_4th-level necromancy_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute   
**Range:** 10 feet   
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

This spell creates an undead servant. Choose up to two piles of bones or corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within range. Your spell imbues the targets with a foul mimicry of life, raising them as undead creatures. Each target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the GM has the creature's game statistics).

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The undeads you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only a number of undead no greater than your level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. You choose which creatures are released. Once released, such undead have no particular feelings of loyalty to you, and in time they may grow in power beyond the undead you can create.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you animate two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 4th. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.
