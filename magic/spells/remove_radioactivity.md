# Remove Radioactivity

_4th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** touch    
**Target:** A creature you can see or a 20 feet radius sphere    
**Duration:** instantaneous

You remove all ongoing effects of radiation from a single target if you succeed at a spellcasting ability check against the DC associated with the radiation effect. The target is cured of both the poisoned condition inflicted by exposure and the radiation sickness disease, clearing any exhaustion caused by it. When cast on an area, a single casting of remove radioactivity removes radiation from a 20-foot-radius area around the point you touch. This spell has no power to negate naturally radioactive materials, and as long as such materials remain in an area, the radiation that was removed may return.
