# Security Seal (R) 
_2nd-level abjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action   
**Range:** Touch   
**Duration:** Until dispelled 

You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, other entryway, or computer system and it becomes locked for the duration. Casting this spell requires you to spend 1 Resolve Point. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can access the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting [_Knock_](knock.md) on the object suppresses _Security Seal_ for 10 minutes.    
While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it, or hack it if it's a computer increases by 10.
