# Corrosive Haze

_4th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 feet    
**Target:** A 5-foot sphere    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A 5-foot cloud of acid-resistant nanites continually converts nearby water vapor into deadly acid. The cloud can share space with a creature and lasts for the duration or until you cast the spell again. As a bonus actions on turns after casting the spell, you can move the cloud up to 30 feet or until it enters a space containing a creature. When the cloud enters a space with a creature, or if the cloud is created there, or if a creature end its turn within the cloud, the creature takes 4d8 acid damage unless it succeeds a Constitution saving throw.

Any creature that takes damage from the cloud takes 2d8 additional acid damage at the end of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** when you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level and higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th. This increase is not applied to the 2d8 lingering damage.

Any creature that takes damage from the cloud takes 10 additional acid damage at the end of its next turn.
