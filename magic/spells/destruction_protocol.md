# Destruction Protocol

_4th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** touch    
**Target:** A technological construct you can see    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Waves of inciting programming ebb from your touch, reprogramming a construct to have murderous intentions toward your enemies. This spell must target a construct that is not already programmed or tasked with harming you. If the target construct is under the control of another creature, the controlling creature can attempt a Charisma saving throw to negate this spell’s effect.

While this spell is in effect, the construct is under your control. On your turn starting when you cast this spell, you must direct it to attack a target; the construct then pursues and attacks this target as best it can. You can change which target the construct attacks. When you stop concentrating or when the spell’s duration otherwise ends, the construct immediately stops following your commands to attack.

**At Higher Levels.** when you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 6th level, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. If you use a spell slot of 7th level, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.
