# Microbot Assault 
_2nd-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 30 ft.    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You conjure technological energy from the air to form four clouds of fist-sized hindering microbots that fill an area you designate. Each cloud uses a 5-foot square and they can share the space of other creatures. When you cast this spell the clouds must form a 10-foot square, or a smaller area. The microbots harass your enemies that share the space with them.

Each round at the beginning of your turn each cloud flies up to 20 ft towards the closest enemy to the cloud if they donâ€™t have one in the same space. You can not control which targets they choose. During your turn, each cloud has an action that can only be used to provide harrying fire towards an enemy in their square, using your spell attack bonus.

The microbots constantly repair themselves and the cloud generates new microbots, so any attack against them is essentially ineffective.
