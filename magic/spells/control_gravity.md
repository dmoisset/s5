# Control Gravity

_6th-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 100 feet    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You can control gravity in an area, causing it to reverse, become zero-g, become normal, or become extremely strong. You decide the effect at the moment of casting the spell. The affected area is a 50-foot-radius, 100- foot high cylinder centered on a point within range.

At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures are affected again by the previously-existing gravity in the area.

**Reverse Gravity.** This spell reverses gravity in the affected area. All creatures and objects that aren't somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.

If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration (assuming normal gravity outside the affected area).

**Zero Gravity.** This spell negates gravity in the affected area. All creatures and objects that aren't somehow anchored to the ground in the area float freely and are subject to the environmental effects of zero-g, including movement restrictions and getting the off-kilter condition. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus preventing the off-kilter condition.

**Extreme Gravity.** This spell increases gravity in the affected area. Creatures fall prone from the change unless they succeed a Dexterity saving throw. All creatures and objects are subject to the environmental effects of extreme gravity , including reductions on speed, jump distance, carrying capacity and range of thrown and projectile weapons. A creature in this environment takes an 1d6 of nonlethal bludgeoning damage at the beginning of its turn. Once a creature takes sufficient nonlethal damage to be reduced to 0 Hit Points, any further damage from extreme gravity is lethal bludgeoning damage.

**Normal Gravity.** This spell changes gravity in the affected area to normal planetary level, even if the area is subject to a different level of gravity. If the area was previously in zero-g, any floating creatures falls immediately taking fall damage if they hit a solid surface. A creature with something to hold nearby can attempt a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach and stop the fall.
