# Implant Data
_2nd-level illusion_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action or 1 hour    
**Range:** Touch    
**Duration:** 8hs or permanent 

You rearrange the circuitry of a computer you touch to convey a certain piece of data when accessed (either normally or hacked). You can implant a single piece of data which should cover a simple fact: the location or physical description of a creature, the value or importance of a creature of object, or another simple statement. When the computer is accessed, this implanted data is the first data that the accessing individual gains, regardless of what the individual was looking for. This does not prevent the user from getting to the rest of the data if it looks beyond. The implanted data vanishes and the spell ends once the data is reviewed (or when the spell ends by reaching its duration). 

This spell can be made permanent with a ritual that requires 1 hour and materials worth 5000 CR. Once itâ€™s made permanent the data temporarily vanishes after being viewed, but returns 1 hour later.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a slot of 3rd level or higher, you can implant an additional piece of data per each level of the slot above 2nd.
