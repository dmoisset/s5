# Supercharge Weapon
_1st-level evocation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Duration:** Up to 1 round 

You supercharge the target weapon. If the weapon’s next attack hits (provided it is made before the end of the next round), the attack deals 4d6 additional damage if the weapon is a single target attack or 2d6 additional damage if the weapon attacks all creatures in an area. This bonus damage is of the same type as the weapon’s normal damage.

**At Higher Levels:**  When you cast this spell using a slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 2d6 (or 1d6 for multi-target weapons) per each level of the slot above 1st.
