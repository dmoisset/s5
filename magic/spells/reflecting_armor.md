# Reflecting Armor
_1st-level abjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action   
**Range:** Self   
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a shimmering skin-like coating of mystical force that covers your body, allowing you to reflect up to 10 damage you take back against your attacker. At any time during this spellâ€™s duration, when you take damage from an attack made with a weapon by a foe within 120 feet, you can choose to dismiss the spell as a reaction. If you do, the armor crackles with energy as it disappears, arcing through the air to strike the attacking creature, which takes an amount of force damage equal to the damage absorbed by the spell. The target can attempt a Dexterity save for half damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the maximum damage absorbed increases by 10 per every two slot levels above 1st.
