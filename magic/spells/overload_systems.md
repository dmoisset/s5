# Overload Systems

_4th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** touch
**Target:** One creature you can see    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You flood the targetâ€™s body with random jolts of electricity or other interference. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target is overwhelmed and potentially unable to perform tasks as normal. While the spell is in effect, the target speeds are halved, and it must roll a d4 at the beginning of its turn to determine which actions it has available:

1: The target can not use neither actions nor bonus actions    
2: The target can use bonus actions but not actions    
3: The target can use actions but not bonus actions    
4: The target can act normally

Also, when the target attempts to take a reaction, there's a 50% change that the target will
be unable to use it.

At the end of its turns, an affected target can attempt a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds,
this effect ends for the target.
