# Instant Virus

_3rd-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Target:** one technological construct    
**Duration:** up to 1 day

You overwhelm your target’s programming, installing a dangerous self-replicating programming virus. This works like a physical or mental disease (your choice), except it ignores the target’s immunity to diseases. This effect is considered a disease for those spells and effects that interact with diseases.

Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target is considered poisoned (even if its type grants it immunity to the poisoned condition) and you afflict the creature with a virus of your choice from any of the ones described below.
At the end of each of the target's turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. After failing three of these saving throws, the virus' effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature recovers from the virus, and the spell ends.

**Bouncing Ball.** Fake sensory input is overlaid in external sensors. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.    
**Defeat Device.** Noise is introduced on servo controls and actuator feedback. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.    
**Love Letter.** The creature's social heuristics are overloaded. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.    
**Code Red.** The creature's processing speed becomes sluggish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the **_confusion_** spell during combat.    
**White Noise.** The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.    
**Stixnet.** Control over the creature bodily functions is compromised. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.
