# :five: Caustic Conversion 
_2nd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You fling magical nanites that convert water vapor around a target within range into deadly acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.
