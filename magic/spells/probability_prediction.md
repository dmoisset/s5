# Probability Prediction

_3rd-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Self    
**Duration:** 1 minute

You open your mind to read the underlying probability of the universe. When casting this spell, roll 1d20 and keep the result. At any point during the duration of this spell, you can use that number to replace a d20 roll (attack roll, saving throw, skill check, etc.) about to be made by you or a creature you can see. You need to declare this before the dice is rolled.
