# Regenerate 
_6th-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 minute    
**Range:** Touch    
**Duration:** 1 hour 

You touch a living creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).    
The target's severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), broken bones, and ruined organs (including eyes) if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.

Regenerate also removes all exhaustion from the target.
