_Divination cantrip_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action   
**Range:** 60ft.

You divine the most vulnerable portion of your opponentâ€™s mind and overload it with a glut of psychic information.

This spell has no effect on non-intelligent creatures (Intelligence score of 2 or less).

This spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).
