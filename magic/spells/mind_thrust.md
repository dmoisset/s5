# Mind Thrust

_Divination cantrip_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action   
**Range:** 90ft.   
**Target:** A creature you can see within range
**Duration:** 1 round

You divine the most vulnerable portion of your opponentâ€™s mind and overload it with a barrage of psychic noise.
The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. If it fails, it takes 3d6 psychic damage,
and is overwhelmed until the end of its next turn. While the spell is active the target
gains the staggered condition and can't use reactions until the end of its next turn.
On a successful save, the target takes half the damage and no further effects.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a 3rd level spell slot or higher, 
the damage increases by 1d6 per spell level above 2nd.
