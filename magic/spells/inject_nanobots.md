# Inject Nanobots 
_2nd-level necromancy_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You concentrate key particles in your blood into tiny biological nanobots that you can inject into a foe with a touch, disrupting and damaging its natural processes. Make a melee spell attack against the target; if you hit, the nanobots deal 4d8 necrotic damage and swarm through the targetâ€™s biological or mechanical systems, causing the creature to be confused, as per [confusion](confusion.md), for the duration. If the target succeeds at a Constitution save, it takes only half damage and negates the confusion effect. A confused target can attempt a Wisdom saving throw at the beginning of its turn each round to end the confusion effect.
