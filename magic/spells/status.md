_2nd-level divination_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Duration:** 8 hours

When you cast this spell you touch up to 8th adjacent creatures. The spell allows you to keep track of comrades who get separated, and to mentally monitor their relative positions and general conditions. You are aware of the direction of and distance to the creatures and any of these conditions or states affecting them: blinded, deafened, dying, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, stunned and unconscious. You know if it is subject to a poison or disease (but not which one). You also know if it has all/some/no Hit Points left, and the same for Stamina Points. Once the spell has been cast upon the targets, the distance between them and the caster does not affect the spell as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If a target leaves the plane (including via Drift travel) or dies, the spell ceases to function for that creature.
