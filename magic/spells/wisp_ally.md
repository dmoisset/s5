# Wisp Ally
_1st-level conjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action   
**Range:** 30 ft.   
**Duration:** 1 minute

You draw forth otherworldly energy to create a small, spherical, floating wisp that can distract your enemies in combat. This wisp can move 60 feet per round in any direction, and you can direct it to a place or to follow a creature as a bonus action on your turn. If the wisp occupies the same space as an enemy at the beginning of your turn the enemy must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, if it fails the wisp provides you the benefit of either harrying fire or covering fire (your choice) against the enemy during the rest of your turn. The wisp follows a targeted enemy within range automatically unless you direct it to change targets. The wisp is made of pure light and energy and canâ€™t be damaged in combat, though it can be dispelled as normal.

In addition to the function described above, the wisp sheds light in a 20-foot radius in a color of your choice (chosen when you cast the spell).
