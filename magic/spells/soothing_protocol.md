# Soothing Protocol

_4th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** touch    
**Target:** A technological construct    
**Duration:** 1 hour

Waves of calming programming ebb from your touch, potentially stabilizing a constructâ€™s harmful intentions toward you and your allies. The target construct must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be convinced that you and your allies pose no threat. If it fails, it is charmed by you until the spell ends, or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. While charmed, it can't do anything that would harm your threaten you, but it otherwise continues to carry out orders and take actions that do not harm or threaten you.

If an affected construct is under the control of a spellcaster or another creature, the controlling creature can spend a full action to remove soothing protocol, as long as it can either touch the construct or give it an order.
