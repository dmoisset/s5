# Erase
_1st-level transmutation_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 30 ft.    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

This spell removes mundane and magical writings and data from any storage (from paper to computer drives). You remove up to 1500 words of text. You can also remove magic runes or glyphs of 1st level or lower.

Non-magical writing on an unattended paper or disconnected data storage is erased automatically.  Magical writing and files/code on active computers require a spell-casting ability check (typically Intelligence) vs the DC of the spell or the computer. Many computers have redundant data and it usually takes them 1 round to restore it from backups; continuous data feeds (like a camera feed) affected by this spell usually arenâ€™t on backup yet.

If you fail to erase something that is part of a trap, or from a computer with countermeasures, the trap/countermeasures are triggered.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a slot of 2nd level or higher, it can remove an additional 1500 words of text per each level of the spell slot above 1st. It can also remove runes or glyphs created by a spell up to the same level of the slot.
