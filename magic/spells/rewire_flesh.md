# Rewire Flesh

_4th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** 60 ft    
**Target:** A living creature you can see within range    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Like rewriting the code that makes up a computer program, you manipulate the target’s DNA
to painfully rewire that target’s biological functions to mimic the cold and rigid
processes of a robot. The target must succeed at a Constitution saving throw, or all
of its movement speeds are halved and it takes 3d6 slashing damage at the beginning of
its turn as its internal organs shift and transform to become more like the inner
components of a robot. Each round, an affected target can attempt a Constitution saving
throw to halve the damage this spell causes.

While this spell is in effect, the target’s body becomes visibly more robotic; its voice is tinny and halting, its movements are jerky, and its face is unmoving and emotionless. The target has a -2 penalty to AC, and has disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight checks) and all Charisma-based ability checks.

Undead, constructs, and other creatures not made of living organic material are not
affected by this spell.
