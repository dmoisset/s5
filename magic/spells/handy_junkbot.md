# Handy Junkbot

_3rd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Target:** 1 bulk of inert electronic equipment    
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You turn a pile of technological junk into a robot that can accomplish helpful tasks. You must target inert, nonworking electronic equipment of at least 1 bulk. Valid targets include a large broken computer system, nonworking or unconnected computer or robot parts, a destroyed robot or another such trashed mechanical system, or any related electronic components or combination of the above as long as the junk is found in a large enough quantity.

While casting this spell, you use your magic and technological know-how to rearrange the junked parts and infuse them with energy and helpful programming. The bot acts after your turn (but not in the same round where you casted the spell) and has the following stats:

> _Small construct (technological, magical)_    
**Armor Class:** 10 + your spellcasting modifier    
**Hit Points:** One quarter your HP (no SP)
**Speed:** 30 ft., fly 15ft.    
**Str:** +0
**Dex:** your spellcasting modifier
**Con:** -1
**Int:** your spellcasting modifier
**Wis:** -1
**Cha:** -1    
**Proficiency Bonus:** equal to yours    
**Skill Proficiencies:** Computers, Engineering, Piloting, and Sleight of Hand

It is consider to have the necessary equipment to perform computers and engineering tasks (equivalent to an engineering kit and hacking kit). A handy junkbot can never attack. 

You can give new basic commands to your handy junkbot telepathically on your turn as a bonus action, and the junkbot can take actions as if it were a normal creature. You are aware when the junkbot has succeeded at or failed a skill check, as well as when it has been attacked or destroyed, but you can perceive nothing else through this basic telepathic link.

When the handy junkbot is destroyed or this spell ends, the electronic equipment you used to create it falls apart into refuse, its circuitry fried beyond anything recognizable. You canâ€™t use this refuse as a target to create another junkbot.
