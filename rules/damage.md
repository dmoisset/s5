# Damage types

Star5er uses the same damage types as D&D. However, for flavor reasons some of those have been renamed:

* This document calls "electricity" damage to lightning damage
* This document calls "sonic" damage to thunder damage

## Abbreviations

Some weapon tables and other places in this document use an abbreviated form of the damage type. for example, a pistol can
deal "1d6 P" (where P is short for "piercing damage") or ("1d4 F", where F is short for "fire damage"). The following table
lists the abbreviations:

|Damage type|Abbreviation|
|-----------|------------|
|Acid|A|
|Bludgeoning|B|
|Cold|C|
|Fire|F|
|Force|Fo|
|Electricity|E|
|Piercing|P|
|Poison|Po|
|Psychic|Ps|
|Necrotic|N|
|Radiant|R|
|Slashing|S|
|Sonic|So|

## Combined damage types

Some weapons or effects indicate two damage types. For example, a plasma sword could be described as dealing "5d8 E & F".
When dealing damage with that weapon, roll 5d8, and half the result (rounded down) will be the first kind of damage listed
(i.e. electricity), and the remaining damage will be fire. If you rolled a total of 25, that means the target will receive
12 points of fire damage and 13 of electricity. Note thats those damages will go separately through any resistance/immunity
that the target may have (for example, if the target is resistant to electricity and vulnerable to fire, it will take 24 points
of damage due to the fire, and 6 due to the electricity)
