# Combat with modern weapons

A sci-fi setting demands a wide variety of weapons and equipment, and these rules can help you deal with it

## Archaic vs modern weapons and armor

All weapons and armors are classified as either archaic or modern. If you reuse any D&D equipment, or equipment coming from any setting that
is medieval or low-tech in general is classified as archaic. Unarmed strikes for humanoids is also considered an archaic weapon.

All of the equipment described in this material is considered "modern" unless stated otherwise. This includes armor made with
advanced materials, hardened plastics and synthetic fibers, and weapons made with industrial high precision manufacturing
and processes. Natural attacks (claws, bites, etc.) are also considered modern.

Modern armor grants resistance against damage from archaic weapons.

## Grenades, and attacks to a location

Some ranged or thrown weapons do not target a specific enemy but a location instead (mainly area of effect weapons like
grenades). If you’re using a grid, choose a grid intersection instead of a square for targeting this kind of attacks.
When using these weapons roll a normal attack roll vs AC 5. On a hit, the attack lands on the desired point. On a miss,
the attack lands 5×1d4 ft away; to see the direction roll 1d8 (assigning numbers to each of the 8 directions).

When you attack a location instead of a creature, you don't apply your Dexterity or Strength modifier to the damage roll.

## New actions in combat

Star5er games will likely have plenty of ranged combat and shootouts. Besides using cover properly, the following actions (available
to all characters) will help you gain a tactical advantage in the field.

### Covering Fire

You use a ranged weapon to attack and provide cover for an ally. As an action, choose an ally and make an attack roll with
a ranged weapon vs AC 15. On a hit, no damage is dealt but you impose disadvantage on the next attack made by any enemy
that you can target against the selected ally, as long as it happens before the beginning of your next turn. Other
effects of firing the weapon with no target (like spending ammunition) are applied normally when making the attack.

### Harrying Fire

You can distract an enemy you can target. As an action, make an attack roll against AC 15. If you hit, you deal no damage,
but the next attack against that enemy gains advantage, as long as the attack happens before the beginning of your next
turn. Other effects of firing without target (like spending ammunition) are applied normally.

### Reload

Reloading weapons (unless the weapon description says otherwise) is an action. You must have the ammunition
readily available.

You can alternatively choose to spend all your movement to reload a weapon as part of another action that makes an
attack roll with that weapon.
