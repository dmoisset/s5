# Health and Resolve

The star5er system uses some rules for health that are significantly different to D&D (inspired on the Starfinder RPG). These rules try to make the feel of the game slightly different than epic fantasy; characters may get some wounds that take a few days to recover, but at the same time, a wounded character should be able to function and go on adventure without ruining the player experience. This also allows making a reliable ship doctor and advanced medical equipment more relevant to the stories that you'll tell while playing Star5er. The rules have less of a chance based element (including how your max HP is determied), making some forms of recovery more reliable.

Besides the usual hit points (and occassional temporary hit points), a Star5er Player Character has the following resources:
* Stamina Points: these are used to absord damage before using your hit points.
* Resolve Points: these are used to delay death, stabilize, and power some special abilities.

A Star5er character does NOT have the following:
* A hit dice pool: Your stamina is easy to recover during short rests, not requiring hit dice
* Death save successes/failures: your resolve points are used to prevent close death.

## Hit Points and Stamina

Characters have 2 separate pools of points to keep track of their endurance to damage. The first one is HP (hit points) and they represent physical health. The second one is SP (Stamina Points) and they represent the ability to shrug off damage (“just a scratch”). Both allow you to absorb damage; SP are always taken before HP (with any leftover going to HP). Temporary HP are still reduced before SP.

You regain up to your maximum SP after a short rest. On a long rest, you just regain a number of HP equal to your level, up to your maximum HP. So small nicks and scratches (lost SP) are recovered very quickly, while wounds (lost HP) may take a few days to fully recover.

Each race grants a certain number of racial HP (typically 4 for most playable classes, 2 for the smaller ones, 6 for particularly strong ones like Dragonborn and Vesk).

Each class grants a specific number of maximum HP per level (ranging from 2 to 4 HP) and a certain number of maxiumum SP per level (2 or 3 SP). A character also gets a number of maximum stamina points equal to his constitution modifier per each level she has (and this maximum is adjusted if the modifier changes). A negative modifier can subtract the SP gained but you can never lose SP:

If you are using a class from other 5e source, use the following table to get the number of HP/SP gained per level based on the kind of hit dice:

|D&D hit die|HP gained per level|SP gained per level|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| d6|2|2+Con (min 0)|
| d8|3|2+Con (min 0)|
|d10|3|3+Con (min 0)|
|d12|4|3+Con (min 0)|

## Resolve Points

As a hero in Star5er, you have resolve — an intrinsic reservoir of grit and luck tied to your talents and often enhanced by your class. Your pool of Resolve Points (RP) allows you to carry on even when everything seems lost.

Only player characters have resolve points; monsters and NPCs usually don’t have them. The GM may choose to give them
resolve points if required to power some ability or other story purposes.

### Calculating Resolve Points

You have a number of Resolve Points equal to half your character level (rounded down, but at least 1) + the modifier of your key ability score (the ability score that is most important to your class at level 1). Even if you have a negative modifier, you always have at least 1 Resolve Point.

Each class description describes which is its key ability score (they can provide more than one which leaves the choice
to the player). For the core D&D classes, their key scores are:

|Class|Key Ability|
|-----|-----------|
|Bard|Cha|
|Barbarian|Con|
|Cleric|Wis|
|Druid|Wis|
|Fighter|Str or Dex|
|Monk|Dex|
|Paladin|Cha|
|Ranger|Str or Dex|
|Rogue|Dex|
|Sorcerer|Cha|
|Wizard|Int|
|Warlock|Cha|

### Spending and Regaining Resolve Points

Resolve Points can be spent in a number of ways, and many classes let you spend them to activate class features and regain resources. Some abilities don’t require you to spend points, but are active only as long as you have a minimum number of Resolve Points available.

Your Resolve Points can never drop below 0. if you are dying (unstable at 0hp) you keep losing Resolve Points. If you would lose Resolve Points due to being dying and don’t have any remaining RP, you’re dead.

Characters can regain any spent Resolve Points by getting a full rest.

### General Uses for Resolve Points

Besides spending Resolve Points to activate class features, they are useful for a few key general purposes:

1. **Taking a short Rest:** You must spend a Resolve point to gain benefits from a short rest (defined otherwise as described in the PH). You can not take a short rest if you do not have RP to spend. If your short rest is interrupted, you gain no benefits but you don’t spend your Resolve Point.
1. **Stabilizing:** If you are at 0 hit points and you have enough Resolve Points, you can spend a number of Resolve Points equal to one-quarter your maximum (minimum 1 RP, maximum 3 RP) on your turn to become stable. This means you’re no longer dying, but you remain unconscious.
1. **Staying in the Fight:** If you are stable and have enough Resolve Points, or if you were knocked unconscious from nonlethal damage, you can spend 1 Resolve Point at the start of your turn to heal 1 Hit Point. You immediately become conscious, and you can take your turn as normal. You can spend Resolve Points to regain Hit Points only if you are at 0 Hit Points and are stable, and you cannot heal more than 1 Hit Point in this way. You cannot spend Resolve Points to both stabilize and stay in the fight in the same round.

Note that use #2 is used instead of Death Saving Throws as described in the D&D rules. Star5er does not use Death Saving Throws for stabilizing. See the “Getting Knocked Out, Stabilizing, Dying” section for more details.

## Some examples

Twitch is a level 9 Ysoki Mechanic. Her Constitution score is 12, giving a bonus of +1. Ysokis are somewhat frail, so they only have 2 racial HP. Mechanics get 3 hp per level, and 2 SP + their constitution modifier per level. Mechanics use their Intelligence as Key Ability, and her score is 16, so her key ability bonus is +3.  Given that we can calculate Twitch's stats:

* Twitch has half her levels (9 halved, i.e. 4) plus her key ability modifier (i.e +3). So she has a maximum of 4+3 = 7 RP
* Twitch gets 2 HP from her race, and 3 HP per each of her 9 levels. So she has a Max HP of 2 + 3×9 = 29 HP.
* For each of her 9 levels, Twitch gets 2 SP + 1 bonus SP given her constitution. So she has a Max SP of (2 + 1)×9 = 27 SP.

Grax is a level 4 Vesk Barbarian. His Constitution bonus is +3 (which is also his key ability bonus). Vesks are sturdy and get 6 racial HP. Barbarians have a d12 hit die in D&D, so in Star5er they get 4 HP per level and 3+Con SP per level. So we can calculate:

* Grax has half her levels (4 halved, i.e. 2) plus his key ability modifier (i.e +3). So she has a maximum of 2+3 = 5 RP
* Grax gets 6 HP from his race, and 4 HP per each of his 4 levels. So she has a Max HP of 6 + 4×4 = 22 HP.
* For each of his 4 levels, Grax gets 3 SP + 3 bonus SP given his constitution. So she has a Max SP of (3 + 3)×4 = 24 SP.

# Getting Knocked Out, Stabilizing, Dying

The rules about counting successes or failures on Death Saving Throws (either rolled or due to other effects like getting damage at 0hp) described in chapter 9 of the Player's Handbook do not apply in Star5er. To determine how a character at 0hp gets stable, dead, or recovers, follow the rules of this chapter, which don’t require rolling Death saving throws at all. When using some converted content from 5e you may require Death saving throws in the way described below in the conversion section; for new content the recommendation is to try to avoid them. This section replaces and extends the “Dropping to 0 Hit Points” section in the PHB

## Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum. Note that your SP maximum doesn’t count towards this purpose.
For example, Grax (from the example above) has 5 SP left and 10 HP left. If he takes 37 damage from an attack, he is reduced to 0 HP and 0 SP, but 22 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals his hit point maximum, Grax dies.

## Falling unconscious

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.

## Dying

If you’re reduced to 0 Hit Points by lethal damage, and assuming that wasn’t an instant death effect, you immediately fall unconscious and can take no actions. You are not considered stable (we will call “dying” to a creature which is at 0 hp and not stable)

While at 0 HPs and dying, you lose 1 Resolve Point each round at the end of your turn. (If your Hit Points reached 0 during your turn, such as from an attack of opportunity you provoked, you do not lose a Resolve Point until the end of your next turn.) This continues until either you die or stabilize (see Stabilizing below).

## Death

If you are at 0 HP, dying, and you have no Resolve Points remaining but would lose Resolve Points for any reason, you’re dead. If you have 0 RP when you are first reduced to 0 HP, you have 1 round to be healed or stabilized. If you have not been healed or stabilized by the end of your turn on the next round, you’re dead.

Note that you can also die from other effects that say so (like Instant Death above, or being reduced to 0 HP by a Disintegrate spell). Nonetheless, certain types of powerful magic and technology can restore life to a dead character.

## Stabilizing

There are several ways to stabilize a dying creature, including first aid, healing, and spending Resolve Points. Once stable, you are no longer dying and no longer lose Resolve Points, but you still have 0 Hit Points and are unconscious.

1. **First Aid:** As an action, you can stabilize a dying creature and keep it from losing any more Resolve Points with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
1. **Healing:** You can stabilize a dying creature and keep it from losing any more Resolve Points with any sort of healing, such as the Spare the Dying cantrip. Healing that raises a dying creature’s Hit Points to 1 or higher makes it conscious and fully functional again, just as if it had never been reduced to 0 HP (however any lost Resolve Points are not recovered).
1. **Using Resolve Points:** If you are dying and you have enough Resolve Points, you can spend a number of Resolve Points equal to one-quarter your maximum (minimum 1 RP, maximum 3 RP) on your turn to immediately stabilize. This means you’re no longer dying, but you remain unconscious and at 0 HP. If you don’t have enough Resolve Points remaining, you cannot use this option and continue to lose Resolve Points as normal as per the dying rules.
1. **Stay in the Fight:** If you are stable and have enough Resolve Points, or if you were knocked unconscious from nonlethal damage, you can spend 1 RP at the beginning of your turn to regain 1 HP. You are no longer dying, immediately become conscious, and can take the rest of your turn as normal. You can spend Resolve Points to regain Hit Points only if you are at 0 HP and stable, and you cannot regain more than 1 HP in this way. You can’t spend Resolve Points to stabilize and to stay in the fight in the same round.

### Taking Damage While Dying or Stable

While you are at 0 hp, if you have any Temporary Hit Points or Stamina Points, any damage you take still reduces those first. If you still would take HP damage while stable, you are once again dying and no longer stable.

If you are at 0hp and dying, the first time each round you take Hit Point damage (whether from an attack, spell or from continuous damage, such as being on fire), you lose 1 Resolve Point. As mentioned earlier, if you would lose Resolve Points but have no Resolve Points remaining, you die instantly.

### Long Term Stability

If you are unconscious and stable but lack the Resolve Points to stay in the fight, there is a chance you will eventually recover on your own. After 1 hour elapses, you must attempt a Constitution Saving Throw. If the result of this throw is 20 or higher, or a natural 20, you regain 1 HP and become conscious again. If the result of the check is at least 10 but less than 20, you don’t regain any Hit Points, but you remain stable and you must attempt another Constitution save 1 hour later. If the result of the check is 9 or lower, or a natural 1, you die. You must continue attempting a Constitution saving throw once per hour until you regain consciousness or until you die. After 8 hours, if you have not regained consciousness or died, you regain consciousness and gain the benefits of a long rest.

If a healer or medic is tending you while you are unconscious and stable, the attendant can attempt a DC 10 Wisdom(Medicine) check each hour before you attempt your Constitution save (this is called a Long-Term Stability check). If the Medicine check is successful, you gain advantage on  your Constitution saving throw, and if your save result is less than 10, you treat it as if the result were a 10.

### Natural and Assisted Healing

When you take a long rest, you regain a number of HP equal to your level (up to your Max HP).

You can use Medicine to provide long-term care to a living, wounded creature. This can take a day or more, requires a medical lab or a medical bay on a starship, and has a DC of 20. If you succeed at the check, the patient recovers Hit Points and ability score damage (as well as recovers from poison states) at twice the normal rate. If you exceed the DC by 10 or more, the patient recovers Hit Points and ability score damage (as well as recovers from poison states) at three times the normal rate. You can tend to up to as many as six patients at a time, attempting a check for each one each day to determine the rate of healing. Only a single check per patient per day is allowed to provide long-term care (although many doctors could use the “Aid Another” action to help).

### Treating Wounds

Some medicine equipment allow you to use Medicine checks with medical equipment to restore Hit Points to a living, wounded creature. This takes 1 minute, and the DC is based on the medical equipment used. If you succeed at the check, you restore 1 Hit Point per level or CR of the creature you are treating. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, you add your Wisdom modifier to the amount healed. A creature can receive this treatment only once every 24-hour period, unless it is delivered in a medical lab. Most medical labs allow you to treat a creature’s deadly wounds at least twice per day.

If you’re not proficient in Medicine you risk making it worse. If your roll is 5 below the DC or less, the patient takes 1d6 damage, and extra d6s if you fail by 10, 15, 20, etc. If you’re proficient in Medicine, failing the treatment has no effect.

# Using this system as a GM

## Monster and NPC Death

Monsters and NPCs don’t have Stamina Points, just a pool of HP.

Most monsters and NPCs don’t have Resolve Points, so injury and death work differently for them. A monster or NPC reduced to 0 HP is dead, unless the last bit of damage it took was nonlethal damage, in which case it is knocked unconscious. If it is ever important to know exactly when a monster dies, such as if you want to capture the creature alive, the GM can decide that a monster reduced to 0 or fewer Hit Points with lethal damage dies in 3 rounds unless it takes any additional damage or receives healing. If a monster or NPC has Resolve Points, the GM can choose whether the monster dies at 0 HP or if it uses the normal PC rules for dying and death.

# Converting 5e content

If you need to adapt some content refering to healing, stabilizing, or death saves, use the following guidelines

Some notes about using 5e rules that affect HP:

* Note that most healing effects and abilities (for example a *Cure Wounds* spell)  only restore HP, but any excess HP does not go into your Stamina pool. Only an effect stating specifically as restoring SP (either in this rules or DM ruling) does so.
* If an effect depends on the current HP of a creature (like the *Sleep* or the *Divine Word* spells), use the current HP+SP instead.
* If an effect reduces your Max HP (like the Wraith's *Life Drain* ability) that still works like that (max hp are reduced, no matter how many SP you had).
* If you are using any healing ability from 5e content that is non-magical and doesn’t involve any sort of treatment on your body (like the Fighter’s class Second Wind), it should probably be changed to restore SP instead of HP.

Some notes about using 5e rules related to death saves:

* Any ability or effect that heals you or stabilizes at the beginning of your turn and prevents you from rolling death saving throws in 5e, works in the same way and prevents you from losing RPs
* Characters under effects that would give them advantage on Death Saving Throws (for example, a Beacon of Hope spell), get instead the ability of stabilize by spending 1 RP, no matter their level..
* Characters under effects that would give them disadvantage on Death Saving Throws, are preventing from using RP to stabilize themselves.
* Any ability or effect that makes you automatically count a failed death saving throw (and is not covered by the textabove), makes you lose a RP instead.
* Any ability or effect that gives you a flat bonus to death saving throws (like a Paladin’s Protection Aura) or a bonus die (like being under the effects of a Bless spell) has no effect on RP use.
* Abilities that provide a bonus, penalty, advantage, or disadvantage explicitly over Death Saving Throws, provide the same effect on the Constitution Saving Throws called in the “Long Term Stability” section.
