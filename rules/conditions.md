# Conditions

The S5 game adds the following conditions that can apply to your character

## Burning

* A burning creature takes a certain amount of fire damage at the start of its turn. The
  amount is specified in the effect that gave it the burning condition.
* A creature can spend an action to remove the condition from itself or from another
  adjacent creature.
* Flames can be extinguished by any effect that normally extinguishes flames on an
  object.

## Off-Kilter

This is a special form of the "Restrained" condition when a creature is floating in Zero-G
without means of propulsion.

* An off-kilter creature is considered restrained.
* The creature starts its turn with 0 movement left.
* The creature can end it by using a bonus action to grab a fixed object and right itself,
  or to throw a heavy object and rebalance.
* An adjacent creature can also spend its action to remove the condition on the affected
  creature.

Note that the restrained condition gives a speed of 0 but that doesn't stop it from being
moved by other effects or inertia. 

## Staggered

* A staggered creature starts its turn with 0 movement left
* The creature can still use any abilities that confer it extra movement during the turn
  (like a Dash action)
