# Environment

Star5er adventures tend to occur in a range of environments quite different than the ones used in medieval fantasy. This section describes some new rules for environments and hazards more present in sci-fi games. You can still use the traditional D&D rules for environments described there (example: movement rules in forest terrain, or drowning rules)

The universe is an endless expanse of adventuring potential. On its billions of worlds, physics create every possible
permutation of geology, while life’s endless creativity gives rise to organisms both eerily familiar and defying
imagination. Regardless of their design, all of these creatures struggle to survive and thrive in their native habitats,
from icy seas and lush fungus jungles to the savage pyroclastic flows of tidally heated moons or the rusting hulks of
ancient alien megastructures. The following section contains rules to help you as GM adjudicate the game universe,
including rules for the vastness of space, for various types of planets and the different terrains that may be found on
them, and for environmental effects and hazards that may come into play in a variety of settings.

## Hazards

### Suffocating :five:

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier
(minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points
or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2
rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.

### Falling

:five:A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.

For environments with high or low gravity, double or halve the damage amounts, respectively. Falling in extreme gravity deals as least triple the listed damage, and potentially even more.


##  Space

The immeasurable gulf of space is home to everything on the Material Plane, housing more stars and planets than could ever
be recorded. During their careers, the player characters will undoubtedly need to venture into space. Traveling from one
planet to another, exiting the atmosphere of a planetoid, or visiting an orbiting space station are all examples of common
travel that require at least a brief time in space. Many hazards of space can be mitigated by 
[wearing armor](../equipment/armor.md#environmental-protection) or a [standard space suit](../equipment/other.md), but sometimes unlucky spacefaring
adventurers get caught without them!

### Cosmic rays

“Cosmic rays” is a catchall term for various interstellar radiation effects. They use the same rules as radiation (see
below). Most habitable planets maintain magnetic fields capable of repelling these emissions. Such protected planets allow,
at most, a low amount of radiation in infrequent bursts. Planets devoid of a protective magnetic field are constantly
assailed by radiation of medium to severe intensity.

Starships and space stations designed to be inhabited are usually shielded against cosmic rays.

### Vacuum

A creature introduced to a vacuum immediately runs out of breath (see [Suffocating](#suffocating-five) above) and takes 1d6 bludgeoning
damage when exposure start and at the beginning of each turn (no saving throw). Because a vacuum has no effective
temperature, the void of outer space presents no dangers from cold temperatures.

Decompression occurs when a creature suddenly transitions from a pressurized environment to a vacuum, such as by being
flung out of an airlock or being inside a sealed structure  that becomes heavily damaged. Such a creature takes 3d6
bludgeoning damage (no saving throw) in addition to any suffocation damage.

## Atmospheres

An atmosphere is a layer of gases held in place by the pull of a planetoid’s gravity. The gravity and temperature of a planetoid impact its ability to retain an atmosphere. Most planets and planetoids support some manner of atmosphere. In addition to hospitable atmospheres, there are various other types of atmosphere that serve as hazards to most life.

### Corrosive

As the name suggests, a corrosive atmosphere eats away at matter. The type and speed of the erosion varies, but the most common use of this term describes atmospheres capable of dissolving most matter. A typical corrosive atmosphere deals anywhere from 1 acid damage per minute up to 10d6 acid damage per round to creatures and objects within. Certain metals and treated materials may be immune to the specific atmosphere of a planet, and often the corrosion can be mitigated with dutiful preparation.

### No atmosphere

A creature on a planet without an atmosphere (or with an atmosphere so thin that it is effectively airless) is exposed to a vacuum (see above).

### Normal

A normal atmosphere is one that can support the majority of breathing life-forms. Most such atmospheres are composed of some combination of oxygen, nitrogen, and other nontoxic gases.

### Thick

A nonacclimated creature operating in a thick atmosphere treats it as somewhat harmful, due to the extra chemical
compounds in the air and the increased atmospheric pressure. Every hour, such a creature must succeed at a Constitution
save (DC = 10 + 1 per previous check) or get the poisoned condition. This effect ends when the creature returns to a
normal atmosphere. Conversely, the increased weight of the air grants advantage to Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to fly or
Dexterity (Piloting) checks to keep an aircraft in flight.

Severely thick atmospheres are far more dangerous. Every minute, a creature in such an atmosphere must succeed at
a Constitution save (DC = 10 + 1 per previous check) or begin to suffocate (see [Suffocating](#suffocating-five) above) as its lungs
cease coping with the density of the oxygen inhaled and lose the strength to keep pumping air into its bloodstream.

### Thin

Thinner atmospheres tend to cause a nonacclimated creature to have difficulty breathing and become extremely tired. 
typical thin atmosphere requires such a creature to succeed at a Constitution save each hour (DC = 10 +1 per
previous check) or gain a level of fatigue. The fatigue ends when the creature returns to a normal atmosphere.

Severely thin atmospheres can cause long-term oxygen deprivation to those affected in addition to the effects of a
standard thin atmosphere. The first time a creature in a severely thin atmosphere fails its Fortitude save, it must
succeed at a DC 20 Constitution save or gets all its ability scores reduced by 1. This reduction lasts until the
creature takes a short or long rest in an atmosphere with normal levels of oxygen. The creature dies if this
reduction brings any of its ability scores to 0.

A creature acclimated to high altitude gains advantage to its saving throw to resist this effect.

### Toxic

Toxic atmospheres are composed of poisonous compounds and vary radically in their consistencies. Some toxic atmospheres are
capable of sustaining oxygen-breathing life-forms, while others immediately suffocate those within them. Regardless of
whether or not they allow creatures to breathe, toxic atmospheres are threats to most living creatures, as they act as an
inhaled poison. Though the specific type of poison varies, many toxic atmospheres act as existing poisons but with radically
different onset times and save DCs. Low-level toxic atmospheres can have onset times measured in hours or days, while
heavily toxic atmospheres have onset times measured in rounds.

### Strange atmospheres

Though it happens rarely, some astronomical objects have atmospheres that seem to defy the laws of reality—usually due to magical interference or technology run amok. Sometimes these atmospheres are infused with a certain type of energy. Such atmospheres function like corrosive atmospheres, except they deal damage of the appropriate energy type (electricity, fire, sonic, etc.).



## Gravity

Gravitational differences between planets have the potential to cripple characters or make them superheroes—and sometimes
both at the same time. Most planets habitable by humanoids have a gravity level defined as standard, which makes them
similar enough that trying to arbitrate the difference isn’t necessary. Others, however, require special consideration. For
planets with gravities that aren’t quite standard but don’t fall into the exact categories below, the GM might decide to
assume the effects are proportional. For example, a planet with half standard gravity allows player characters to jump twice
as high, whereas one with 1-1/2 standard gravity cuts jump heights by a third. In all cases, these effects last until the
PCs adjust to the gravity (a process that typically takes about a month of living under such conditions).

**The "off-kilter" condition:** This is a special form of the "Restrained" condition when you are floating in Zero-G
without means of propulsion. It has the same effects, but you can end it by using a bonus action to grab a fixed object
and right yourself, or to throw a heavy object and rebalance. An adjacent creature can also spend its action to remove
the condition on you. Note that the restrained condition gives you a speed of 0 but that doesn't stop you from being
moved by other effects or inertia. If you start your turn with this condition you're considered to have spent all of
your movement even if you grab something during your turn. You can gain some additional movement by using your Dash
action as normal to push against other object.

### Extreme Gravity

A planet where the gravity is at least five times as strong as standard gravity is extremely dangerous to most creatures. In addition to the limitations of high gravity (see below), a creature in this environment takes an amount of nonlethal bludgeoning damage at the beginning of its turn (at least 1d6, but potentially more, depending on the intensity of the gravity). Once a character takes sufficient nonlethal damage to be reduced to 0 Hit Points, any further damage from extreme gravity is lethal bludgeoning damage.

### High Gravity

On high-gravity worlds, characters are burdened by their increased weight, and their physical abilities are affected
accordingly. On a high-gravity world, where the gravity is at least twice as strong as standard gravity, a character (and
her gear) weighs twice as much as on a standard-gravity world, but she has the same amount of strength. Such characters move
at half speed, can jump only half as high or as far, and can lift only half as much. Thrown weapons (though not those of
natives) have their ranges cut in half as they fall to the ground more rapidly. Modifications to running, jumping, and
lifting can be negated by certain magic or technology, but projectiles remain affected. Characters who remain in a
high-gravity environment for long periods (more than a day) often become fatigued and remain so until they leave the planet
or become accustomed to the gravity.

### Low Gravity

Low-gravity worlds are liberating to most species acclimated to standard-gravity worlds. Such characters’ muscles are far
more effective than normal. On a low-gravity world, where the gravity is no greater than a third of standard gravity, PCs
can jump three times as high and as far and lift three times as much. (Movement speed, however, stays the same, as moving in
great bounds is awkward and difficult to control.) Thrown weapons have their range categories tripled.

### Standard Gravity

Standard-gravity worlds have gravity approximately the same as Earth’s gravity, which is the gravity of most D&D settings.

### Zero Gravity

Movement in zero gravity (also referred to as zero-g) is not the same as flight. Controlled movement is difficult without some form of propulsion, and creatures without something to push off from often find themselves floating aimlessly. A creature in a zero-gravity environment can’t use their movement to move its speed or crawl. If a creature is adjacent to or in the same square as an object (including a wall, floor, or ceiling) or another creature one size category smaller than itself or larger, it can use its movement to push off that object or creature, moving at half its speed in a direction of its choosing (as appropriate); if that object or creature is movable, it begins moving in the opposite direction at that same speed.

### Moving in Zero-G:

A creature that moved in a given direction continues to move (regardless of its speed) in that direction at the same
speed at the beginning of its turn each round (this is involuntary movement); it must move the full distance unless it
is able to change its motion by latching on to an object or creature, pushing off in a new direction, or creating thrust
of some kind (all of which are done as part of their movement). If a creature runs into a solid object during its
movement, it must succeed at a DC 15 Dex(Acrobatics) or Str(Athletics) check to safely stop its movement; failure means
that creature is off-kilter. If a creature runs into another creature during its movement, both creatures must each
attempt a DC 15 Acrobatics or Athletics check to avoid gaining the off-kilter condition. A creature anchored to a
solid object (such as by the boot clamps available with most armor) receives advantage on this check.

If provided with sufficient handholds, a creature with a climb speed can move along a wall at full speed, as can any
creature that succeeds at a DC 15 Acrobatics or Athletics check. Creatures that fly via methods that require an atmosphere,
such as wings or turbofans, can't use their fly speeds in a vacuum; once they reenter an atmosphere, they can recover and
get their bearings within 1d4 rounds, after which they can fly normally. Magical flight and methods of flight that provide
their own thrust, such as maneuvering jets, are not affected. A character in a zero-gravity environment can lift and carry
10 times her normal amount.

## Radiation

Radiation is a very real threat to adventurers, whether it’s the radiation emitted from stars or the radiation generated by various technological wonders of the universe.

Radiation is a poison effect that weakens an affected creature and can also inflict an affected creature with a disease
called radiation sickness. Radiation dangers are organized into four categories: low, medium, high, and severe. Radiation emanates from a source and covers a sphere shaped area, although some objects may block the effect if they cover its line of sight and are made of some radiation absorbing material. It does not go around corners.

When a radiation source is described, it will indicate the radiation intensity and radius. for each increment of the same radius, the radiation continues but at a lower intensity, until it gets from low to no. For example, a leaky ship reactor that's emanating high radiation on a 15ft radius, while expose characters up to 30 feet with medium radiation, and up to 45 feet with low radiation.

### Radiation exposure

Each creature entering or starting its turn in an area affected by radiation takes an amount of poison damage based on the radiation level (see table below) which can be halved by succeeding at a Constitution saving throw vs poison (see table below for DC). A creature failing this saving throw also gains the poisoned condition as long as it stays in the affected area (even if it succeeds at further throws). Ending your turn in a non radiated area ends the poisoned effect.

If you have failed a saving throw against radiation and are still poisoned, any other saves vs radiation where you
roll below 16 afflicts you with radiation sickness

|Radiation Level|Save DC|Exposure damage|
|---------------|------:|--------------:|
|Low|13|1d6|
|Medium|15|2d6|
|High|17|4d6|
|Severe|20|6d6|

### Radiation Sickness

Exposure to radiation may leave longer term sequels, with symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and loss of hair. This
"radiation sickness" is not contagious and can be treated. Radiation sickness is contracted as described in the
"Radiation exposure" section.

A creature that contracts radiation sickness gains the poisoned condition and a level of fatigue. Those conditions
can not be removed by the usual means, and the only way to lose them is being cured of the radiation sickness.

After each long rest, an affected creature must make a Constitution saving throw vs poison, with the DC based on
the radiation level at the time the sickness was contracted. On a failure, it gains another level of fatigue that
can not be removed. On a success, one of the levels of fatigue go away. If a successful saving throw reduces the
infected creature's level of Exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

Medical care can improve recovery. Another character giving treatment using a Medical kit or facility can attempt
a Wis(Medicine) check with the same DC as the radiation. On a success, the afflicted creature is prevented from
gaining fatigue levels on its next saving throw.
