# Environment

Star5er adventures tend to occur in a range of environments quite different than the ones used in medieval fantasy.
The Starfinder SRD has detailed descriptions of
[different environments and their rules](https://www.aonsrd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=234).
It should definitely be used as a guide for ideas and description. Mechanically, you should do the following:

1. If an environment is described in the PHB (or 5e material you use) and has mechanical rules, use those even if the
   CRB has conflicting rules (example: movement rules in forest terrain, or drowning rules)
1. If an environment is described only in the CRB and its description can be applied without referencing any Starfinder
   specific concept, use it. (Example: effect of high gravity on falling damage or movement speed.)
1. If the CRB has any rule that references starfinder specific concepts, you’ll find an adapted rule in this section
   (example: something imposing the “sickened” condition which doesn’t exist in 5e, or asking for skill checks that have
   a different DC scale in 5e). 

##  Space

Follow CRB rules in general. For exposure to vacuum, the following rule should be used instead:

### Vacuum

A creature introduced to a vacuum immediately runs out of breath (see Suffocating in the PHB) and takes 1d6 bludgeoning
damage when exposure start and at the beginning of each turn (no saving throw). Because a vacuum has no effective
temperature, the void of outer space presents no dangers from cold temperatures.

Decompression occurs when a creature suddenly transitions from a pressurized environment to a vacuum, such as by being
flung out of an airlock or being inside a sealed structure  that becomes heavily damaged. Such a creature takes 3d6
bludgeoning damage (no saving throw) in addition to any suffocation damage.

## Atmosphere


The following CRB rules have been adapted to Star5er

### Thin

Thinner atmospheres tend to cause a nonacclimated creature to have difficulty breathing and become extremely tired. 
typical thin atmosphere requires such a creature to succeed at a Constitution save each hour (DC = 10 +1 per
previous check) or gain a level of fatigue. The fatigue ends when the creature returns to a normal atmosphere.

Severely thin atmospheres can cause long-term oxygen deprivation to those affected in addition to the effects of a
standard thin atmosphere. The first time a creature in a severely thin atmosphere fails its Fortitude save, it must
succeed at a DC 20 Constitution save or gets all its ability scores reduced by 1. This reduction lasts until the
creature takes a short or long rest in an atmosphere with normal levels of oxygen. The creature dies if this
reduction brings any of its ability scores to 0.

A creature acclimated to high altitude gains advantage to its saving throw to resist this effect.

### Thick

A nonacclimated creature operating in a thick atmosphere treats it as somewhat harmful, due to the extra chemical
compounds in the air and the increased atmospheric pressure. Every hour, such a creature must succeed at a Constitution
save (DC = 10 + 1 per previous check) or get the poisoned condition. This effect ends when the creature returns to a
normal atmosphere. Conversely, the increased weight of the air grants advantage to Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to fly or
Dexterity (Piloting) checks to keep an aircraft in flight.

Severely thick atmospheres are far more dangerous. Every minute, a creature in such an atmosphere must succeed at
a Constitution save (DC = 10 + 1 per previous check) or begin to suffocate (see Suffocating in the PHB) as its lungs
cease coping with the density of the oxygen inhaled and lose the strength to keep pumping air into its bloodstream.


## Gravity

Most CRB rules for creatures under different levels of gravity can be normally applied. There is a single section
with changes:

**The “off-kilter” condition:** This is a special form of the “Restrained” condition when you are floating in Zero-G
without means of propulsion. It has the same effects, but you can end it by using a bonus action to grab a fixed object
and right yourself, or to throw a heavy object and rebalance. An adjacent creature can also spend its action to remove
the condition on you. Note that the restrained condition gives you a speed of 0 but that doesn’t stop you from being
moved by other effects or inertia. If you start your turn with this condition you’re considered to have spent all of
your movement even if you grab something during your turn. You can gain some additional movement by using your Dash
action as normal to push against other object.

### Moving in Zero-G:

A creature that moves in a given direction continues to move (regardless of its speed) in that direction at the same
speed at the beginning of its turn each round (this is involuntary movement); it must move the full distance unless it
is able to change its motion by latching on to an object or creature, pushing off in a new direction, or creating thrust
of some kind (all of which are done as part of their movement). If a creature runs into a solid object during its
movement, it must succeed at a DC 15 Dex(Acrobatics) or Str(Athletics) check to safely stop its movement; failure means
that creature is off-kilter. If a creature runs into another creature during its movement, both creatures must each
attempt a DC 15 Acrobatics or Athletics check to avoid gaining the off-kilter condition. A creature anchored to a
solid object (such as by the boot clamps available with most armor) receives advantage on this check.

If provided with sufficient handholds, a creature with a climb speed can move along a wall at full speed, as can any
creature that succeeds at a DC 15 Acrobatics or Athletics check. Creatures that fly via methods that require an atmosphere,
such as wings or turbofans, can’t use their fly speeds in a vacuum; once they reenter an atmosphere, they can recover and
get their bearings within 1d4 rounds, after which they can fly normally. Magical flight and methods of flight that provide
their own thrust, such as maneuvering jets, are not affected. A character in a zero-gravity environment can lift and carry
10 times her normal amount.

### Falling
Use the PHB rules for falling damage under standard gravity. For planets with high or low gravity, double or halve the
damage amounts, respectively. Falling in extreme gravity deals as least triple the listed damage, and potentially even
more.

## Radiation

The rules described in the CRB for Radiation exposure should be replaced by the following

Radiation is a poison effect that weakens an affected creature and can also inflict an affected creature with a disease
called radiation sickness. Radiation dangers are organized into four categories: low, medium, high, and severe.

Radiation works as an emanation (see the CRB rules), and affects any creature entering the area, not requiring neither
contact, ingestion, inhalation, or injury. 

### Radiation exposure

Each creature entering or starting its turn in an area affected by radiation takes an amount of poison damage based
on the radiation level (see table below) which can be halved by succeeding at a Constitution saving throw vs poison
(see table below for DC). A creature failing this saving throw also gains the poisoned condition as long as it stays
in the affected area (even if it succeeds at further throws). Ending your turn in a non radiated area ends the effect.

If you have failed a saving throw against radiation and are still poisoned, any other saves vs radiation where you
roll below 16 afflict you with radiation sickness

|Radiation Level|Save DC|Exposure damage|
|---------------|------:|--------------:|
|Low|13|1d6|
|Medium|15|2d6|
|High|17|4d6|
|Severe|20|6d6|

### Radiation Sickness

Exposure to radiation may leave longer term sequels, with symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and loss of hair. This
“radiation sickness” is not contagious and can be treated. Radiation sickness is contracted as described in the
“Radiation exposure” section.

A creature that contracts radiation sickness gains the poisoned condition and a level of fatigue. Those conditions
can not be removed by the usual means, and the only way to lose them is being cured of the radiation sickness.

After each long rest, an affected creature must make a Constitution saving throw vs poison, with the DC based on
the radiation level at the time the sickness was contracted. On a failure, it gains another level of fatigue that
can not be removed. On a success, one of the levels of fatigue go away. If a successful saving throw reduces the
infected creature’s level of Exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

Medical care can improve recovery. Another character giving treatment using a Medical kit or facility can attempt
a Wis(Medicine) check with the same DC as the radiation. On a success, the afflicted creature is prevented from
gaining fatigue levels on its next saving throw.
