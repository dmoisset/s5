# Skills for the future

Characters in a sci-fi setting needs new skills to interact with an advanced world. The skill list has been slightly
changed from D&D, to introduce those that may be relevant in a sci-fi setting (like Piloting and Computers) and
removing importance to those that are not probably going to be used often or be as relevant (like Animal Handling or
Performance).

Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient
in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrate
a focus on that aspect. (A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a
monster's skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.)

The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.)
See an ability's description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated
with an ability.

### Strength

* Athletics

### Dexterity

* Acrobatics
* Piloting
* Sleight of Hand
* Stealth

### Intelligence

* Computers
* Culture
* Engineering
* Investigation
* Mysticism
* Physical Science

### Wisdom

* Insight
* Life Science
* Medicine
* Perception
* Survival

### Charisma

* Deception
* Intimidation
* Persuasion

Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill--for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.”
At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case,
proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill.
Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.

For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check.
If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the
character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.

## Skills with Different Abilities

Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics,
for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply
to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and
skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to disarm a
movement sensitive bomb trigger, your GM might call for a Dexterity check to see if you have the steady hand required to
not activate the bomb. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Engineering and ask for a
Dexterity(Engineering) check. So if you're proficient in Engineering, you add your proficiency bonus to the Dexterity
check just as you would normally do for a Intelligence (Engineering) check. 

## Skill descriptions

The following alphabetical list describes all the Star5er skills. The skills labeled with :five: are unchanged from D&D

* :five: **Acrobatics:** Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation,
  such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking
  ship's deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts,
  including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.
* :five: **Athletics:**  Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing,
  jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:
    * You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while
      something is trying to knock you off.
    * You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.
    * You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or
      another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.
* **Computers:** Your Intelligence (Computers) check measures your skill to operate, manipulate, and hack into
  computer systems. If you don’t have physical access to a computer system’s user interface, you must use a hacking
  kit to access and manipulate the system. See the computers section under equipment for more details and examples of
  using this skill. You can also use this skill to forge or to detect forged electronic documents, and operate a ship's
  sensors and science equipment.
* **Culture:** Your Intelligence (Culture) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events,
  historical people, ancient nations, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations. You can use an Intelligence
  (Culture) check to recall general customs of different cultures or about sciences such as anthropology, geography or
  sociology.
* :five: **Deception:**  Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either
  verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to
  telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through
  gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight
  face while telling a blatant lie.  
* **Engineering:** You make an Intelligence (Engineering) check to identify, build, repair, or disable technological
  devices; assess the stability of structures and machinery; and properly arm and disarm explosives. If you don’t
  have the proper tools for an engineering task, you can not add your proficiency in this skill when rolling the check.
  This skill is also used to operate the power systems on a starship.
* :five: **Insight:** Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature,
  such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language,
  speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.
* :five: **Intimidation:**  When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical
  violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of
  a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince
  a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.
* :five: **Investigation:**  When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an
  Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a
  wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine that two unrelated pieces of equipment were manufactured in the same
  factory. Poring through an online data archive in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an
  Intelligence (Investigation) check.
* **Life Science:** Your Intelligence (Life Science) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, flora and
  fauna of different areas and planets. You van make checks to see if you know some fact about biology, zoology,
  bioengineering, ecology or genetics.
* **Medicine:**  A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness. It can also
  be used to use medical equipment, treat wounds, poison and radiation effects.
* **Mysticism:** Your Intelligence (Mysticism) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers,
  religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults. It measures also your ability to recall lore
  about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those
  planes.
* :five: **Perception:** Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something.
  It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to
  hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the
  forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a
  road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or light under a closed secret door.
* :five: **Persuasion:** When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good
  nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good
  faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include
  convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a
  crowd of townsfolk.
* **Physical Science**: You make an Intelligence (Physical Science) check to reveal your knowledge in the scientific study
  of non-living systems, from the tiniest atoms to the largest celestial bodies. This skill covers sciences like
  physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology, climatology, etc.
* **Piloting:** Your Dexterity (Piloting) check lets you drive vehicles, pilot starships, and navigate. This skill is also
  used to fire starship weapons. Details on its use can be seen in the starship rules.
* :five: **Sleight of Hand:** Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something
  on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also
  call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a wallet off another person or slip
  something out of another person's pocket.
* :five: **Stealth:** Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards,
  slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.
* **Survival:** The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt game in the wilderness,
  guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid
  quicksand and other natural hazards. You can also use this skill to calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount
  from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions and to control live mounts when you attempt a risky maneuver.

## Converting 5e content

If you're are using content designed for 5th edition D&D in your Star5er game, you may find that it refers to skills
that no longer exit. You may find a magical mask that gives you advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks, a
written module may call for a Intelligence (History) check to find some clue, or a character background you like may
give you proficiency in Intelligence (Nature) checks.

To convert this, just convert the skill using the following list:

* Intelligence(Arcana) and Intelligence(Religion) become Intelligence (Mysticism)
* Intelligence(History) becomes Intelligence(Culture)
* Intelligence(Nature) becomes Intelligence(Life Science)
* Wisdom(Animal Handling) becomes Wisdom(Survival)
* Charisma(Performance) becomes a tool proficiency in a specific instrument of your choice.

## Converting Starfinder content

If you have content that you wish to convert from Starfinder that references skills, you should do the following:

* If a skill in Star5er has the same name, use that one.
* Use Charisma (Deception) checks instead of Bluff.
* Use Charisma (Deception) or proficiency in disguise kits (as adjudicated by the GM) instead of the Disguise skill
* Use Wisdom (Insight) instead of Sense motive
* Use Charisma (Persuasion) instead of Diplomacy
* You may want to use Intelligence(Investigation) checks instead of some Perception checks (as adjudicated by the GM)

Note that Medicine is Wisdom based in 5e and Star5er (instead of Intelligence based as in Starfinder). No changes are required here but results may differ.
